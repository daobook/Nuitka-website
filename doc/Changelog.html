<h2>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-fixes" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span></code> creation wasn’t annotating its possible exception exit
from hashing values and is not as free of side effects as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code> creations are. Fixed in 0.6.19.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, experimental options got lost when switching from MSVC
to MinGW64, making them have no effect. Fixed in 0.6.19.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, Clang from MinGW64 doesn’t support LTO at this time,
default to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no</span></code> for it. Fixed in 0.6.19.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian: Fix, failed to detect Debian unstable as suitable for
linking, it doesn’t have the release number. Fixed in 0.6.19.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added data files for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pygsheets</span></code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, paths from plugin related file paths need to be made absolute
before used internally, otherwise the cache can fail to deduplicate
them. Fixed in 0.6.19.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: With gcc before 5, e.g. on CentOS 7, where we switch to
using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">g++</span></code>, the gcc version checks could crash. Fixed in 0.6.19.2
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Disable MinGW64 wildcard expansion for command line
arguments. This was breaking command lines with arguments like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--filename</span> <span class="pre">*.txt</span></code>, which under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd.exe</span></code> are left alone by the
shell, and are to be expanded by the program. Fixed in 0.6.19.2
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added missing implicit dependency needed for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--follow-stdlib</span></code> with Python for some uses of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locale</span></code>
module. Fixed in 0.6.19.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added workarounds for newest <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code> that wants to set
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__code__</span></code> objects and required improvements for macOS library
handling. Fixed in 0.6.19.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Caching of DLL dependencies for main programs was not really
working, requiring to detect them anew for every standalone
compilation. Fixed in 0.6.19.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, wasn’t checking the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zstandard</span></code> version and as a result could
crash if too old versions of it. This is now checked.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="new-features">
<h2>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#new-features" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support for compression in onefile mode through the use of an
other Python installation, that has the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zstandard</span></code> module
installed. With this it will work with 2.6 or higher, but require a
3.5 or higher Python with it installed in either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PATH</span></code> or on
Windows in the registry alternatively.</p></li>
<li><p>Added UPX plugin to compress created extension modules and binaries
and for standalone mode, the included DLLs. For onefile, the
compression is not useful since it is as payload already compressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Added more explicit way to list usable MSVC versions with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--msvc=list</span></code> rather than requiring an invalid value. Check values
given in the same way that Scons will do.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="optimization">
<h2>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#optimization" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Standalone: Do not include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">encodings.bz2_codec</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">encodings.idna</span></code> anymore, these are not file system encodings, but
require extension modules.</p></li>

<h1>Nuitka Release 0.6.19<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-6-19" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>This release adds support for 3.10 while also adding very many new
optimization, and doing a lot of bug fixes.</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib.import_module</span></code> with expressions that need
releases, i.e. are not constant values, could crash the compilation.
Fixed in 0.6.18.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>After a fix for the previous release, modules that fail to import are
attempted again when another import is executed. However, during this
initialization for top level module in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--module</span></code> mode, this was
was done repeatedly, and could cause issues. Fixed in 0.6.18.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Ignore warning given by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">patchelf</span></code> on Linux with at
least newer OpenSUSE. Fixed in 0.6.18.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, need to avoid computing large values out of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;</span></code> operation as
well. Fixed in 0.6.18.2 already.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># This large value was computed at runtime and then if used, also</span>
<span class="c1"># converted to a string and potentially hashed, taking a long time.</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Standalone: Ignore warning given by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">patchelf</span></code> on Linux about a
workaround being applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib.import_module</span></code> were not correctly creating
code for dynamic argument values that need to be released, causing
the compilation to report the error. Fixed in 0.6.18.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>MSYS2: Fix, the console scripts are actually good for it as opposed
to CPython, and the batch scripts should not be installed. Fixed in
0.6.18.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Setuptools: Added support older version of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools</span></code> in meta
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code> integration of Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib.import_module</span></code> with 2 arguments that are
dynamic, were not working at all. Fixed in 0.6.18.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Compiling with MinGW64 without <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> was not working
due to issues in Scons. Fixed in 0.6.18.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">repr</span></code> built-in was falsely annotated as producing a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> value, but it can be also derived or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> in Python2.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, attribute nodes were not considering the value they are looking
up on. Now that more values will know to have the attributes, that
was causing errors. Fixed in 0.6.18.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, left shifting can also produce large values and needs to be
avoided in that case, similar to what we do for multiplications
already. Fixed in 0.6.18.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: The new option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--disable-ccache</span></code> didn’t really have the
intended effect. Fixed in 0.6.18.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: The progress bar was causing tearing and corrupted outputs, when
outputs were made, now using proper <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tqdm</span></code> API for doing it, this
has been solved. Fixed in 0.6.18.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the constant value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.version_info</span></code> didn’t yet have support
for its type to be also a compile time constant in e.g. tuples. Fixed
in 0.6.18.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Assertions were not disabled, and on Windows with MinGW64
this lead to including the C filenames of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zstd</span></code> inline copy
files and obviously less optimal code. Fixed in 0.6.18.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bottle.ext</span></code> loading extensions to
resolve at compile time. Fixed in 0.6.18.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seedir</span></code> required data file. Fixed in
0.6.18.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>MSYS2: Failed to link when using the static libpython, which is also
now the default for MSYS2. Fixed in 0.6.18.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6+: Fix, the intended finalizer of compiled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asyncgen</span></code> was
not present and in fact associated to help type. This could have
caused corruption, but that was also very unlikely. Fixed in 0.6.18.5
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, need to set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__file__</span></code> before executing modules, as
some modules, e.g. newer PyWin32 use them to locate things during
their initialization already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Handle all PyWin32 modules that need the special DLLs and
not just a few.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pth</span></code> files create module namespaces with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__path__</span></code>
that does not exist, ignore these in module importing.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2.6-3.4: Fix, modules with an error could use their module name
after it was released.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: When providing arguments, the method suggested in the docs
is not compatible with all other systems, e.g. not
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools_rust</span></code> for which a two elemented tuple form needs to be
used for values. Added support for that and documented its use as
well in the User Manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.7+: Do no longer allow deleting cell values, this can lead to
corruption and should be avoided, it seems unlikely outside of tests
anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for more ciphers and hashes with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pycryptodome</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pycryptodomex</span></code>, while also only including
Ciphers when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Was not including modules or packages only referenced in
the entry point definition, but not in the list of packages. That is
not compatible and has been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, must not expose the constants blob from extension modules, as
loading these into a compiled binary can cause issues in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for including OpenGL and SSL libraries with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide6</span></code> packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd</span></code> files created for uninstalled Python and
accelerated programs to find the Python installation were not passing
command line arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Executing modules with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--run</span></code> was not working properly
due to missing escaping of file paths.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, parsing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></code> files that make relative imports was not
resolving them correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, when disabling the console on Windows, make sure the
file handles still work and are not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, need to claim all OS versions of Windows as supported,
otherwise e.g. high DPI features are not available.</p></li>

<h2>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Programs that are to be executed with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> flag, can now be
compiled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=-m</span></code> and will then behave in a
compatible way, i.e. load the containing package first, and have a
proper <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__package__</span></code> value at run time.</p></li>
<li><p>We now can write XML reports with information about the compilation.
This is initially for use in PGO tests, to decide if the expected
forms of inclusions have happened and should grow into a proper
reporting tool over time. At this point, the report is not very
useful yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for Python 3.10, only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">match</span></code> statements are not
completely supported. Variations with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code> matches that also assign
are not allowed currently.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Allow using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--clang</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--mingw64</span></code> to e.g. use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang.exe</span></code> that is contained in the Nuitka automatic download
rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcc.exe</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for Kivy. Works through a plugin that is automatically
enabled and needs no other inputs, detecting everything from using
Kivy at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Added initial support for Haiku OS, a clone of BeOS with a few
differences in their Python installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Added experimental plugin <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trio</span></code> that works around issues with that
package.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Also trust hard imports made on the module level in function level
code, this unlocks many more static optimization e.g. with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.version_info</span></code> when the import and the use are not on the same
level.</p></li>
<li><p>For the built-in type method calls with generic implementation, we
now do faster method descriptor calls. These avoid creating a
temporary <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyCFunction</span></code> object, that the normal call slot would,
this should make these calls faster. Checking them for compiled
function, etc. was only wasteful, so this makes it more direct.</p></li>
<li><p>Loop and normal merge traces were keeping assignments made before the
loop or inside a branch, that was otherwise unused alive. This should
enable more optimization for code with branches and loops. Also
unused loop traces are now recognized and removed as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding merges of escaped traces with the unescaped trace, there is
no point in them. This was actually happening a lot and should mean a
scalability improvement and unlock new optimization as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid escaping un-init traces. Unset values need not be considered as
potentially modified as that cannot be done.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> shape is now detected through variables, this enables
many optimization on the function level.</p></li>
<li><p>Added many <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> operation nodes.</p>
<p>These are specifically all methods with no arguments, as these are
very generic to add, introduced a base class for them, where we know
they all have no effect or raise, as these functions are all
guaranteed to succeed and can be served by a common base class.</p>
<p>This covers the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.capitalize</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.upper</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.lower</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.swapcase</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.title</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.isalnum</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.isalpha</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.isdigit</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.islower</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.isupper</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.isspace</span></code>,
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.istitle</span></code> functions.</p>
<p>For static optimization <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.find</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.rfind</span></code> were added, as
they are e.g. used in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.version.find(...)</span></code> style in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os</span></code>
module, helping to decide to not consider <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OS/2</span></code> only modules.</p>
<p>Then, support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.index</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.rindex</span></code> was added, as
these are very similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.find</span></code> forms, only that these may
raise an exception.</p>
<p>Also add support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.split</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.rsplit</span></code> which will be
used sometimes for code needed to be compile time computed, to e.g.
detect imports.</p>
<p>Same goes for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">endswith</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">startswith</span></code>, the later is e.g.
popular with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.platform</span></code> checks, and can remove a lot of code
from compilation with them now being decided at compile time.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A few <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> methods are still missing, with time we will achieve
all of them, but this will take time.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added trust for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.builtin_module_names</span></code> as well. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os</span></code>
module is using it to make platform determinations.</p></li>
<li><p>When writing constant values, esp. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>
values, an encoding of “last value” has been added, avoiding the need
to repeat the same value again, making many values more compact.</p></li>
<li><p>When starting Nuitka, it usually restarts itself with information
collected in a mode without the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site</span></code> module loaded, and with hash
randomization disabled, for deterministic behaviour. There is a
option to prevent this from happening, where the goal is to avoid it,
e.g. in testing, say for the coverage taking, but that meant to parse
the options twice, which also loads a lot of code.</p>
<p>Now only a minimal amount of code is used, and the options are parsed
only on the restart, and then an error is raised when it notices, it
was not allowed to do so. This also makes code a lot cleaner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specialized comparison code for Python2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> and Python3 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code>
code, making these operations much faster to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Specialized comparison code for Python2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> and Python3
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> code, making these operations much faster to use, currently
only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">==</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!=</span></code> are fully accelerated, the other comparisons
will follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable static libpython with Python3 Debian packages too. As with
Python2, this will improve the performance of the created binary a
lot and reduce size for standalone distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparisons with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> also consider value traces and
go through variables as well where possible. So far only the rich
comparisons and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span></code> did that.</p></li>
<li><p>Create fixed import nodes in re-formulations rather than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__</span></code> nodes, avoiding later optimization doing that, and of
course that’s simpler code too.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 3.10: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">union</span></code> types as compiled time
constants.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules are now fully optimized before considering which modules they
are in turn using, this avoids temporary dependencies, that later
turn out unused, and can shorten the compilation in some cases by a
lot of time.</p></li>
<li><p>On platforms without a static link library, in LTO mode, and with
gcc, we can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-O3</span></code> mode, which doesn’t work for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libpython</span></code>, but that’s not used there. This also includes fake
static libpython, as used by MinGW64 and Anaconda on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> plugin now also handles newer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code> and
knows more about the standard library, and its runners which it will
exclude from compilation if use for it. Currently that is not the
default, but it should become that.</p></li>

sure people are aware of core features.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gi</span></code> plugin is now always on. The copying of the typelib when

that’s not needed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code> plugin is new and also always on. It previously
was part of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code> plugin, which is doing too many unrelated

<li><p>Distutils: Improved error messages when using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code> integration and failing to provide packages to compile.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Removed now unused feature to rename modules on import, as
it was only making the code more complex, while being no more needed
after recently adding a place for meta path based importers to be
accounted for.</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter: Use embedded Tweet in Credits, and regular follow button in
User Manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Warnings about imports not done, are now only given when optimization
can not remove the usage, and no options relatved to following have
been given.</p></li>
<li><p>Added Windows version to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--version</span></code> output of Nuitka. This is to
more clearly recognize Windows 10 from Windows 11 report, and also
the odd Windows 7 report, where tool chain will be different.</p></li>
<li><p>In Visual Code, the default Python used is now 3.9 in the “Linux” C
configuration. This matches Debian Bullseye.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicer outputs from check mode of the autoformat as run for CI
testing, displays problematic files more clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove broken links to old bug tracker that is no longer online from
the Changelog.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: When hitting CTRL-C during initial technical import detection, no
longer ask to submit a bug report with the exception stack, instead
exit cleanly.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Enable LTO mode for MinGW64 and other gcc by default. We

<li><p>The importing code got a major overhaul and no longer works with
relative filenames, or filenames combined with package names, and

Nuitka, that had grown to address various requirements discovered
over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Major cleanup of Jinja2 template organisation.</p>
<p>Renamed all C templates from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.j2</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.c.j2</span></code> for clarity, this
was not done fully consistent before. Also move all C templates to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.codegen</span></code> package data, it will be confusing to make a
difference between ones used during compile time and for the static
generation, and the lines are going to become blurry.</p>
<p>Added Jinja2 new macro <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CHECK_OBJECTS</span></code> to avoid branches on

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release is another big step forward.</p>
<p>The amount of optimization added is again very large, some of which yet
again unlocks more static optimization of module imports, that
previously would have to be considered implicit. Now analysing these on
the function level as well, we can start searching for cases, where it
could be done, but is not done yet.</p>
<p>After starting with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>, method optimization has focused on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code>
which is esp. important for static optimization of imports. The next
goal will here be to cover <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> which are important for run time
performance and currently not yet optimized. Future releases will
progress there, and also add more types.</p>
<p>The C type specialization for Python3 has finally progressed, such that
it is also covering the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> and as such not limited
to Python2 as much. The focus now needs to turn back to not working with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObject</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> for these types, but e.g. with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> to make it
directly work with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CLONG</span></code> rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LONG</span></code> for which structural
changes in code generation will be needed.</p>
<p>For scalability, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> work has not yet progressed as much
as to be able to enable it by default. It needs to be more possible to
disable it where it causes problems, e.g. when somebody really wants to
include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytest</span></code> and test frameworks generally, that’s something that
needs to be doable. Compiling without <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> plugin is something
that is immediately noticeable in exploding module amounts. It is very
urgently recommended to enable it for your compilations.</p>
<p>The support for Windows has been further refined, actually fixing a few
important issues, esp. for the Qt bindings too.</p>
<p>This release adds support for 3.10 outside of very special <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">match</span></code>
statements, bringing Nuitka back to where it works great with recent
Python. Unfortunately <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">orderedset</span></code> is not available for it yet, which
means it will be slower than 3.9 during compilation.</p>
<p>Overall, Nuitka is closing many open lines of action with this. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools</span></code> support has yet again improved and at this point should
be very good.</p>

<h1>Nuitka Release 0.6.18<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-6-18" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>This release has a focus on new features of all kinds, and then also new
kinds of performance improvements, some of which enable static
optimization of what normally would be dynamic imports, while also
polishing plugins and adding also many new features and a huge amount of
organisational changes.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Python3.6+: Fixes to asyncgen, need to raise <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StopAsyncInteration</span></code>
rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></code> in some situations to be fully
compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Fix, LTO mode was always enabled for onefile compilation,
but not all compilers support it yet, e.g. MinGW64 did not. Fixed in
0.6.17.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type</span></code> calls with 3 arguments didn’t annotate their potential
exception exit. Fixed in 0.6.17.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, trusted module constants were not working properly in all cases.
Fixed in 0.6.17.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg-resources</span></code> exiting with error at compile time for
unresolved requirements in compiled code, but these can of course
still be optional, i.e. that code would never run. Instead give only
a warning, and runtime fail on these. Fixed in 0.6.17.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Prevent the inclusion of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">drm</span></code> libraries on Linux, they
have to come from the target OS at runtime. Fixed in 0.6.17.2
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added missing implicit dependency for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipcqueue</span></code>
module. Fixed in 0.6.17.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, Qt webengine support for everything but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide2</span></code> wasn’t
working properly. Partially fixed in 0.6.17.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, bootstrap splash screen code for Windows was missing in
release packages. Fixed in 0.6.17.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, could crash on known implicit data directories not present.
Fixed in 0.6.17.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Disable download of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> binary for M1 architecture and
systems before macOS 10.14 as it doesn’t work on these. Fixed in
0.6.17.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pendulum.locals</span></code> handling for Python 3.6 was
regressed. Fixed in 0.6.17.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Make sure the child process is cleaned up even after its
successful exit. Fixed in 0.6.17.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xmlschema</span></code>. Fixed in 0.6.17.4
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">curses</span></code> on Windows. Fixed in

already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.4+: Up until Python3.7 inclusive, a workaround for stream
encoding (was ASCII), causing crashes on output of non-ASCII, other
Python versions are not affected. Fixed in 0.6.17.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Workaround for LTO error messages from older gcc versions.
Fixed in 0.6.17.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win32print</span></code>. Fixed in 0.6.17.6
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, need to prevent usage of static <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libpython</span></code> in module mode or
else on some Python versions, linker errors can happen. Fixed in
0.6.17.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Do not load <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site</span></code> module early anymore. This might
have caused issues in some configurations, but really only would be
needed for loading <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspect</span></code> which doesn`t depend on it in
standalone mode. Fixed in 0.6.17.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, could crash with generator expressions in finally blocks of
tried blocks that return. Fixed in 0.6.17.7 already.</p>

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">typelib</span></code> files and sets the search path for them in standalone
mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added necessary datafiles for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eel</span></code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QtWebEngine</span></code> to all Qt bindings and
also make it work on Linux. Before only PySide2 on Windows was
supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">all</span></code> built-in was wrongly assuming that bytes
values could not be false, but in fact they are if they contain
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\0</span></code> which is actually false. The same does not happen for string
values, but that’s a difference to be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: The LTO was supposed to be used automatically on with MSVC
14.2 or higher, but that was regressed and has been repaired now.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Extension modules contained in packages, depending on
their mode of loading had the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__package__</span></code> value set to a wrong
value, which at least impacted new matplotlib detection of Qt
backend.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">install</span></code> was installing binaries for
no good reason.</p></li>

<h2>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Setuptools support. Documented <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bdist_nuitka</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bdist_wheel</span></code>
integration and added support for Nuitka as a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code> package
backend in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyproject.toml</span></code> files. Using Nuitka to build your
wheels is supposed to be easy now.</p></li>
<li><p>Added experimental support for Python 3.10, there are however still
important issues with compatibility with the CPython 3.9 test suite
with at least asyncgen and coroutines.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: For app bundles, version information can be provided with the
new option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--macos-app-version</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added Python vendor detection of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Anaconda</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyenv</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Apple</span>
<span class="pre">Python</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyenv</span></code> and output the result in version output, this
should make it easiert to analyse reported issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Also handle the usage of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code> for metadata version
resolution of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg-resources</span></code> standard plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data-files</span></code> standard plugin now reads configuration
from a Yaml file that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data-files.yml</span></code> making it more accessible
for contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Allow enforcing usage of MSVC with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--msvc=latest</span></code>. This
allows you to prevent accidental usage of MinGW64 on Windows, when
MSVC is intended, but achieves that without fixing the version to
use.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for LTO with MinGW64 on Windows, this was
previously limited to the MSVC compiler only.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--debugger</span></code> with the downloaded
MinGW64 provided <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gdb.exe</span></code>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It doesn`t work when executed from a Git bash prompt, but e.g.
from a standard command prompt.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added new experimental flag for compiled types to inherit from
uncompiled types. This should allow easier and more complete
compatibility, making even code in extension modules that uses
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObject_IsInstance</span></code> work, providing support for packages like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pydanctic</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The Qt binding plugins now resolve <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyqtgraph</span></code> selection
of binding by hard coding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QT_LIB</span></code>. This will allow to resolve its
own dynamic imports depending on that variable at compile time. At
this time, the compile time analysis is not covering all cases yet,
but we hope to get there.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Provide <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minOS</span></code> for standalone builds, derived from the
setting of the Python used to create it.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Added new option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--disable-ccache</span></code> to prevent Nuitka from
injecting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> (Clang, gcc) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache</span></code> (MSVC) for caching
the C results of the compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Added experimental support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyQt6</span></code>. While using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide2</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide6</span></code> is very much recommended with Nuitka, this
allows its use.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Added option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--low-memory</span></code> to allow the user to specify that
the compilation should attempt to use less memory where possible,
this increases compile times, but might enable compilation on some
weaker machines.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h2>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Added dedicated attribute nodes for attribute values that match names
of dictionary operations. These are optimized into dedicate nodes for
methods of dictionaries should their expression have an exact
dictionary shape. These in turn optimize calls on them statically
into dictionary operations. This is done for all methods of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>
for both Python2 and Python3, namely <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">items</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iteritems</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">itervalues</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iterkeys</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viewvalues</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">viewkeys</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pop</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setdefault</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">has_key</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clear</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copy</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update</span></code>.</p>
<p>The new operation nodes also add compile time optimization for being
used on constant values where possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also added dedicated attribute nodes for string operations. For
operations, currently only part of the methods are done. These are
currently only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">join</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strip</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lstrip</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rstrip</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">partition</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rpartition</span></code>. Besides performance, this subset was
enough to cover compile time evaluation of module name computation
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib.import_module</span></code> as done by SWIG bindings, allowing
these implicit dependencies to be discovered at compile time without
any help, marking a significant improvement for standalone usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate type shape for dictionary <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> nodes, this was
missing unlike in the generic <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster processing of “expression only” statement nodes. These are
nodes, where a value is computed, but then not used, it still needs
to be accounted for though, representing the value release.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">something</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># ignores return value, means statement only node</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Windows: Enabled LTO by default with MinGW64, which makes it produce
much faster results. It now yield faster binaries than MSVC 2019 with
pystone.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for C level PGO (Profile Guided Optimization)
with MSVC and MinGW64, allowing extra speed boosts from the C
compilation on Windows as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Better handling of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requests.packages</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">six.moves</span></code>. The old handling could duplicate their code. Now uses
a new mechanism to resolve metapath based importer effects at compile
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid useless exception checks in our dictionary helpers, as these
could only occur when working with dictionary overloads, which we
know to not be the case.</p></li>
<li><p>For nodes, have dedicated child mixin classes for nodes with a single
child value and for nodes with a tuple of children, so that these
common kind of nodes operate faster and don’t have to check at
runtime what type they are during access.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually make use of the egg cache. Nuitka was unpacking eggs in
every compilation, but in wheel installs, these can be quite common
and should be faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Star arguments annotated their type shape, but the methods to check
for dictionary exactly were not affected by this preventing
optimization in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> configuration for main programs present in the
modules of the standard library, these can be removed from the
compilation and should lower dependencies detected.</p></li>
<li><p>Using static libpython with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyenv</span></code> automatically. This should give
both smaller (standalone mode) and faster results as is the case when
using this feature..</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Added improvements to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> plugin for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gevent</span></code> to avoid including its testing framework.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.9+: Faster calls into uncompiled functions from compiled code
using newly introduced API of that version.</p></li>
<li><p>Statically optimize <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib.import_module</span></code> calls with constant
args into fixed name imports.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.version_info</span></code> to be used as a compile time
constant. This should enable many checks to be done at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Added hard import and static optimization for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">typing.TYPE_CHECKING</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also compute named import lookup through variables, expanding their
use to more cases, e.g. like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">version_info</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">major</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span>
   <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Also optimize compile time comparisons through variable names if
possible, i.e. the value cannot have changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster calls of uncompiled code with Python3.9 or higher avoiding DLL
call overhead.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Commercial: There are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Buy</span> <span class="pre">Now</span></code> buttons available now for the
direct purchase of the <a class="reference external" href="/pages/commercial.html">Nuitka Commercial</a>

possible. This is using Stripe. Get in touch with me if you want to
use bank transfer, which is of course still best for me.</p></li>
<li><p>The main script runners for Python2 have been renamed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka2</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka2-run</span></code>, which is consistent with what we do for Python3,
and avoids issues where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> folder ends up in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.path</span></code> and
prevents the loading of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka</span></code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for Visual Studio 2022 by updating the inline
copy of Scons used for Windows to version 4.3.0, on non Windows, the
other ones will keep being used.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Requiring latest MinGW64 with version 11.2 as released by
winlibs, because this is known to allow LTO, where previous releases
were missing needed binaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Reject standalone mode usage with Apple Python, as it works only with
the other supported Pythons, avoiding pitfalls in attempting to
distribute it.</p></li>
<li><p>Move hosting of documentation to Sphinx, added Changelog and some
early parts of API documentation there too. This gives much more
readable results than what we have done so far with Nikola. More
things will move there.</p></li>
<li><p>User Manual: Add description how to access code attributes in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka-project</span></code> style options.</p></li>
<li><p>User Manual: Added commands used to generate performance numbers for
Python.</p></li>
<li><p>User Manual: List other Python’s for which static linking is supposed
to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved help for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--include-package</span></code> with a hint how to exclude
some of the subpackages.</p></li>
<li><p>Started using Jinja2 in code templates with a few types, adding basic
infrastructure to do that. This will be expanded in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated plugin documentation with more recent information.</p></li>
<li><p>Added Python flavor as detected to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--version</span></code> output for
improved bug reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux: Added distribution name to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--version</span></code> output for improved
bug reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Always enable the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gevent</span></code> plugin, we want to achieve this for all
plugins, and this is only a step in that direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Added project URLs for PyPI, so people looking at it from there have
some immediate places to checkout.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian: Use common code for included PDF files, which have page
styles and automatic corrections for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rst2pdf</span></code> applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated to latest <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">black</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isort</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pylint</span></code> versions.</p></li>

with Python2 and avoids issues, where the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> folder in

<h2>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a change of mind <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-plugin</span></code> has become the only form to
enable a plugin used in documentation and tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Massive cleanup of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code> and Qt binding plugins, e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyside2</span></code>. Data files and DLLs are now provided through proper
declarative objects rather than copied manually. The handling of
PyQt5 from the plugin should have improved as a side effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Massive cleanups of all documentation in ReST format. Plenty of
formatting errors were resolved. Many typos were identified and
globally fixed. Spellings e.g. of “Developer Manual” are now enforced
with automatic replacements. Also missing or wrong quotes were turned
to proper methods. Also enforce code language for shell scripts to be
the same everywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed last usages of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getPythonFlags()</span></code> and made the function
private, replacing their use with dedicated function to check for
individual flags.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid string comparison with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.utils.getOS()</span></code> and instead add
accessors that are more readable, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.utils.isMacOS()</span></code> and
put them to use where it makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Replaced usages of string tests in list of python flags specified,
with functions that check for a specific name with a speaking
function name.</p></li>
<li><p>Added mixin for expressions that have no side effect outside of their
value, providing common method implementation more consistently.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove code geared to using old PyLint and on Python2, we no longer
use that. Also removed annotations only used for overriding Python2
builtins from Nuitka code.</p></li>
<li><p>The PDF specific annotations were moved into being applied only in
the PDF building step, avoiding errors for raw PDF directives.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply Visual Code autoformat to our Yaml files. This is unfortunately
not and automatic formatting yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce dedicated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.utils.Json</span></code> module, as we intend to
expand its usage, e.g. for caching.</p></li>
<li><p>Replacing remaining usages of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> functions with uses of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.Tracing</span></code> instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Massive cleanup of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gevent</span></code> plugin, user proper method to
execute code after module load, rather than source patching without
need. The plugin no longer messes with inclusions that other code
already provides for standalone.</p></li>
<li><p>Using own helper to update <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys</span></code> module attributes, to avoid errors
from old C compilers, and also cleaning up using code to not have to
cast on string constants.</p></li>
<li><p>More consistent naming of plugin classes, and enforce a relationship
of detector class names to the names of detected plugins. The new
naming consistency is now enforced.</p></li>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release is again a huge step forward. It refines on PGO and LTO for
C level to work with all relevant compilers. Internally Python level PGO
is prepared, but only a future release will feature it. With that,
scalability improvements as well as even more performance improvements
will be unlocked.</p>
<p>The amount of optimization added this time is even bigger, some of which
unlocks static optimization of module imports, that previously would
have to be considered implicit. This work will need one extra step,
namely to also trace hard imports on the function level, then this will
be an extremely powerful tool to solve these kinds of issues in the
future. The next release will have this and go even further in this
area.</p>
<p>With the dictionary methods, and some string methods, also a whole new
kind of optimization has been started. These will make working with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code> containers faster, but obviously a lot of ground is to cover
there still, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> values are a natural target not yet started.
Future releases will progress here.</p>
<p>Type specialization for Python3 has not progressed though, and will have
to be featured in a future releases though.</p>
<p>For scalability, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> work has continued, and this should
be the last release, where this is not on by default. Compiling without
it is something that is immediately noticeable in exploding module
amounts. It is very urgently recommended to enable it for your
compilations.</p>
<p>The support for macOS has been refined, with version information being
possible to add, and adding information to the binary about which OSes
are supported, as well as rejecting Apple Python, which is only a trap
if you want to deploy to other OS versions. More work will be needed to
support <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyenv</span></code> or even Homebrew there too, for now CPython is still
the recommended platform to use.</p>
<p>This release achieves major compatibility improvements. And of course,
the experimental support for 3.10 is not the least. The next release
will strive to complete the support for it fully, but this should be
usable at least, for now please stay on 3.9 if you can.</p>

<li><p>Windows: Fix, onefile binaries were not working after being signed.
This now works.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added missing implicit dependency for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Modules giving <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code> from source were not
properly handled, giving runtime <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImportError</span></code>. Now they are giving
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the LTO mode has issues with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">incbin</span></code> usage on older gcc, so
use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">linker</span></code> mode when it is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, locals dict codes were not properly checking errors
that the mapping might raise when setting values.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, modules named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">entry</span></code> were causing compile time errors in the
C stage.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Never include files from OS private frameworks in standalone
mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the python flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=no_warning</span></code> wasn’t working on
all platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Fix, the main code of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site</span></code> module wasn’t
executing, so that its added builtins were not there. Of course, you
ought to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=no_site</span></code> to not have it in the normal
case.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Added code path to handle edited standard library source
code which then has no valid bytecode file.</p></li>
<li><p>Anaconda: In module mode, the CondaCC wasn’t recognized as form of
gcc.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, bytecode modules could shadow compiled modules of the same name.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Fix, expansion of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%PID%</span></code> wasn’t working properly on
non-Windows, making temp paths less unique. The time stamp is not
necessarily enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multiprocessing</span></code> error exits from slave processes were not
reporting tracebacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xcbglintegrations</span></code> to the list of sensible Qt
plugins to include by default, otherwise rendering will be inferior.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">platformthemes</span></code> to the list of sensible Qt

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id14" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added experimental support for C level PGO (Profile Guided
Optimization), which runs your program and then uses feedback from
the execution. At this time only gcc is supported, and only C
compiler is collecting feedback. Check the User Manual for a table
with current results.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Added experimental support for creating application bundles.
For these, icons can be specified and console can be disabled. But at
this time, onefile and accelerated mode are not yet usable with it,
only standalone mode works.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Add support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg_resources.require</span></code> calls to be
resolved at compile time. These are not working at runtime, but this
avoids the issue very nicely.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Massive improvements to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> plugin, it can
now make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scipy</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skimage</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pywt</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code> use much less packages and has better error handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> ability ability to append code to a
module, which might get used in the future by other plugins that need
some sort of post load changes to be applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Added ability to replace code of functions at parse time,
and use this in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> plugin to replace functions that do
unnecessary stuff with variants that often just do nothing. This is
illustrated here.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This example is removing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gevent</span></code> code that loads dependencies used
for their CI release process, that need not be part of normal
programs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added ability to persist source code changes done by plugins in the
Python installation. This is considered experimental and needs write
access to the Python installation, so this is best done in a
virtualenv and it may confuse plugins.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multiprocessing.tracker</span></code> and spawn mode for all
platforms. For non-default modes outside of Windows, you need to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-plugin=multiprocessing</span></code> to use these.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Allow multiple entry points to be provided by one or several
plugins for the same modules. These are now merged into one
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fix for numpy not working when compiling with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=no_docstrings</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, method calls were not respecting descriptors provided by types
with non-generic attribute lookups.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Add support for using self-compiled Python3 from the build
folder too.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for Nuitka-Python 2.7, which will be our faster Python
fork.</p></li>
<li><p>Colorized output for error outputs encountered in Scons, these are
now yellow for better recognition.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id15">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id15" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Faster threading code was used for Python3.8 or higher, and this has
been extended to 3.7 on Windows, but we won’t be able to have it
other platforms and not on earlier Python3 versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster calls esp. with keyword arguments. Call with keywords no
longer create dictionaries if the call target supports that, and with
3.8 or higher, non-compiled code that allows vectorcall is taken
advantage of.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster class creation that avoids creation of argument tuples and
dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster attribute check code in case of non-present attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster unbound method calls, unlike bound methods calls these were
not optimized as well yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Type shapes for star arguments are now known and used in
optimization.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Python2: Faster old-style class creation. These are classes that do
not explicitly inherit from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Faster string comparisons for Python by specializing for the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> type as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Added specialization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code> comparisons too. These
are naturally very much the same as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> comparisons in Python2.</p></li>
<li><p>Added specialization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> comparisons too. We had them for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuples</span></code> only so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster method calls when called from Python core, our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tp_call</span></code>
slot wasn’t as good as it can be.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimization: Faster deep copies of constants. This can speed up
constant calls with mutable types. Before it was checking the type
too often to be fast.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow using static linking with Debian Python giving much better
performance with the system Python. This is actually a huge
improvement as it makes things much faster. So far it’s only
automatically enabled for Python2, but it seems to work for Python3
on Debian too. Needs more tweaking in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimization: Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">functools</span></code> module to the list of hard imports
in preparation of optimizing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">functools.partial</span></code> to work better
with compiled functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Demote to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xrange</span></code> when iterating over <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range</span></code> calls,
even for small ranges, they are always faster. Previously this was
only done for values with at least 256 values.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable LTO automatically for Debian Python, this also allows more
optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable LTO automatically for Anaconda with CondaCC on non-Windows,
also allowing more optimization.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id16">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id16" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added section in the User Manual on how to deal with memory issues
and C compiler bugs. This is a frequent topic and should serve as a
pointer for this kind of issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--lto</span></code> option was changed to require an argument, so that it
can also be disabled. The default is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">auto</span></code> which is the old
behaviour where it’s enabled if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-progress</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-progressbar</span></code> in order to make it
more clear what it’s about. Previously it was possible to relate it
to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--show-progress</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>No longer require specific versions of dependencies in our
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements.txt</span></code> and relegate those to only being in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements-devel.txt</span></code> such that by default Nuitka doesn’t
collide with user requirements on those same packages which
absolutely all the time don’t really make a difference.</p></li>
<li><p>Added ability to check all unpushed changes with pylint with a new
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">./bin/check-nuitka-with-pylint</span> <span class="pre">--unpushed</span></code> option. Before it was
only possible to make the check (quickly) with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--diff</span></code>, but that
stopped working after commits are made.</p></li>
<li><p>Revived support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vmprof</span></code> based analysis of compiled programs,
but it requires a fork of it now.</p></li>
<li><p>Make Windows specific compiler options visible on all platforms.
There is no point in them being errors, instead warnings are given
when they are specified on non-Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Added project variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Commercial</span></code> for use in Nuitka project
syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent use of metavars for nicer help output should make it more
readable.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ast</span></code> tree dumps in case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KeyboardInterrupt</span></code> exceptions,
they are just very noisy. Also not annotate where Nuitka was in
optimization when a plugin is asking to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sysexit</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id17">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id17" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Encoding names for UTF8 in calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.encode()</span></code> were used
inconsistent with and without dashes in the source code, added
cleanup to autoformat that picks the one blessed.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleanup taking of runtime traces of DLLs used in preparation for
using it in main code eventually, moving it to a dedicated module.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid special names for Nuitka options in test runner, this only adds
a level of confusion. Needs more work in future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Unify implementation to create modules into single function. We had 3
forms, one in recursion, one for main module, and one for plugin
generated code. This makes it much easier to understand and use in
plugins.</p></li>
<li><p>Further reduced code duplication between the two Scons files, but
more work will be needed there.</p></li>
<li><p>Escaped variables are still known to be assigned/unassigned rather
than unknown, allowing for many optimizations to still work on them.,
esp. for immutable value</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced autoformat for rest documents, bullet list spacing is now
consistent and spelling of organisational is unified automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved icon conversion functionality to separate module, so it can be
reused for other platforms more easily.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id18">
<h3>Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id18" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reflected</span></code> test, because of Nuitka special needs to
restart with variable Python flags. This could be reverted though,
since Nuitka no longer needs anything outside inline copies, and
therefore no longer loads from site packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> plugin in standalone tests of Numpy, Pandas and
tests to reduce their compile times, these have become much more
manageable now.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced checks for used files to use proper below path checks for
their ignoring.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove reflected test, compiling Nuitka with Nuitka has gotten too
difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify constants integrity at program end in debug mode again, so we
catch corruption of them in tests.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id19">
<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id19" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is one of the most important ones in a long time. The PGO
and LTO, and static libpython work make a big different for performance
of created binaries.</p>
<p>The amount of optimization added is also huge, calls are much faster
now, and object creations too. These avoiding to go through actual
dictionaries and tuples in most cases when compiled code interacts gives
very significant gains. This can be seen in the increase of pystone
performance.</p>
<p>The new type specializations allow many operations to be much faster.
More work will follow in this area and important types, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> do not have specialized comparisons for Python3, holding it back
somewhat to where our Python2 performance is for these things.</p>
<p>For scalability, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> work is extremely valuable, and this
plugin should become active by default in the future, for now it must be
strongly recommended. It needs more control over what parts you want to
deactivate from it, in case of it causing problems, then we can and
should do it.</p>
<p>The support for macOS has been enhanced a lot, and will become perfect
in the next release (currently develop). The bundle mode is needed for
all kinds of GUI programs to not need a console. This platform is
becoming as well supported as the others now.</p>
<p>Generally this release marks a huge step forward. We hope to add Python
level PGO in the coming releases, for type knowledge retrofitted without
any annotations used. Benchmarks will become more fun clearly.</p>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id21" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pyton3.5+: Added support for onefile compression. This is using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zstd</span></code> which is known to give very good compression with very high
decompression, much better than e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zlib</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Added onefile support.</p></li>
<li><p>FreeBSD: Added onefile support.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux: Added method to use tempdir onefile support as used on other
platforms as an alternative to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AppImage</span></code> based.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for recursive addition of files from directories with
patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>Attaching the payload to onefile now has a progress bar too.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Prelimary support for the yet unfinished Nuitka-Python that
allows static linking and higher performance on Windows, esp. with
Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: In acceleration mode, for uninstalled Python, now a CMD file
is created rather than copying the DLL to the binary directory. That
avoids conflicts with architectures and of course useless file
copies.</p></li>
<li><p>New abilities for plugin <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anti-bloat</span></code> allow to make it an error
when certain modules are imported. Added more specific options for
usual trouble makes, esp. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytest</span></code> are causing an
explosion for some programs, while being unused code. This makes it
now easier to oversee this.</p></li>

files live with an environment variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NUITKA_CACHE_DIR</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-o</span></code> option now also works with onefile mode, it previously
rejected anything but acceleration mode. Fixed in 0.6.15.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: It’s now possible for multiple plugins to provide pre or
post load code for the same module.</p></li>
<li><p>Added indications for compilation modes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">standalone</span></code> and

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id32" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>For Windows, it’s now easier than ever to create an icon for your
deployment, because you can use PNG files, and need not produce ICO
files anymore, with Nuitka doing that for you.</p>
<p>The onefile for Linux had some more or less severe problems that got
addressed, esp. also when it came to QML applications with PySide.</p>
<p>On the side, we are preparing to greatly improve the caching of Nuitka,
starting with retaining modules that were demoted to bytecode. There are
changes in this release, to support that, but it’s not yet complete. We
expect that scalability will then be possible to improve even further.</p>
<p>Generally this is mostly a maintenance release, which outside of the
threading performance improvement has very little to offer for faster
execution, but that actually does a lot. Unfortunately right now it’s
limited to 3.9, but some of the newer Python’s will also be supported in
later releases.</p>

expanding standalone support, esp. for PySide2, but also and in general
with plugins added that workaround <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg_resources</span></code> usage for version

how it’s supposed to be. Instead, only if it’s in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.modules</span></code>

<div class="section" id="id35">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id35" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Faster binary operations.</p>
<p>Applying lessons learnt during the enhancements for in-place
operations that initially gave worse results than some manual code,
we apply the same tricks for all binary operations, which speeds them
up by significant margins, e.g. 30% for float addition, 25% for
Python int addition, and still 6% for Python int addition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More direct optimization of unary operations on constant value.</p>
<p>Without this, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-1</span></code> was not directly a constant value, but had to go
through the unary <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> operation, which it still does, but now it’s
done at tree building time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More direct optimization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span></code> in branches.</p>
<p>Invertible comparisons, i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code>
do not have do be done during optimization. This mainly avoids noise
during optimization from such unimportant steps.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More direct optimization for constant slices.</p>
<p>These are used in Python3 for all subscripts, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a[1:2]</span></code> will
use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slice(1,2)</span></code> effectively. For Python2 they are used less often,
but still. This also avoids a lot of noise during optimization,
mostly on Python3</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scons: Avoid writing database to disk entirely.</p>
<p>This saves a bit of disk churn and makes it unnecessary to specify
the location such that it doesn’t collide between Python versions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For optimization passes, use previous max total as minimum for next
pass. That will usually be a more accurate result, rather than
starting from 1 again. Part of 0.6.13.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancements to the branch merging improve the scalability of Nuitka
somewhat, although the merging itself is still not very scalable,
there are some modules that are very slow to optimize still.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">orderset</span></code> if available over the inline copy for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OrderedSet</span></code>
which is much faster and improves Nuitka compile times.</p></li>

optimization for its functions.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id39" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>For PySide2 things became more perfect, but it takes upstream patches
unfortunately such that only PySide6.1 will be working out of the box
outside of the commercial offering. We will also attempt to provide
workarounds, but there are some things that cannot be done that way.</p>
<p>This release added some more scalability to the optimization process,
however there will be more work needed to make efficient branch merges.</p>
<p>For onefile, a feature to include whole directories had been missing,
and could not easily be achieved with the existing options. This further
rounds this up, now what’s considered missing is compression and macOS
support, both of which should be coming in a future release.</p>
<p>For the performance side of things, the binary operator work can
actually yield pretty good gains, with double digit improvements, but
this covers only so much. Much more C types and better type tracing
would be needed, but there was no progress on this front. Future
releases will have to revisit the type tracing to make sure, we know
more about loop variables, etc. so we can achieve the near C speed we
are looking for, at least in the field of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> performance.</p>
<p>This release has largely been driven by the <a class="reference external" href="/doc/commercial.html">Nuitka Commercial</a> offering and needs for compatibility with more
code, which is of course always a good thing.</p>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id41" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added new options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-force-stdout-spec</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-force-stderr-spec</span></code> to force output to files. The paths
provided at compile time can resolve symbolic paths, and are intended
to e.g. place these files near the executable. Check the User Manual
for a table of the currently supported values. At this time, the
feature is limited to Windows, where the need arose first, but it
will be ported to other supported OSes eventually. These are most
useful for programs run as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-disable-console</span></code> or with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--enable-plugin=windows-service</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-onefile-tempdir-spec</span></code> to provide
the temporary directory used with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-onefile-tempdir</span></code> in
onefile mode, you can now select your own pattern, and e.g. hardcode
a base directory of your choice rather than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%TEMP</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added experimental support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide2</span></code> with workarounds for
compiled methods not being accepted by its core. There are known
issues with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide2</span></code> still, but it’s working fine for some people
now. Upstream patches will have to be created to remove the need for
workarounds and full support.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id42">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id42" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use binary operation code for their in-place variants too, giving
substantial performance improvements in all cases that were not dealt
with manually already, but were covered in standard binary
operations. Until now only some string, some float operations were
caught sped up, most often due to findings of Nuitka being terribly
slower, e.g. not reusing string memory for inplace concatenation, but
now all operations have code that avoids a generic code path, that is
also very slow on Windows due calling to using the embedded Python
via API being slow.</p></li>
<li><p>For mixed type operations, there was only one direction provided,
which caused fallbacks to slower forms, e.g. with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> values leading to inconsistent results, such that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code> being accelerated or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Added C boolean optimization for a few operations that didn’t have
it, as these allow to avoid doing full computation of what the object
result would have to do. This is not exhausted fully yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Faster <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+=</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-=</span></code> binary and in-place
operations with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> values providing specialized code helpers
that are much faster, esp. in cases where no new storage is allocated
for in-place results and where not a lot of digits are involved.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: The Python3 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> code is the Python2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> type and
benefits from the optimization of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+=</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-=</span></code> code as
well, but of course its use is relatively rare.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__future__</span></code> imports to become hard imports, so more
efficient code is generated for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Counting of instances had a runtime impact by providing a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__del__</span></code>
that was still needed to be executed and limits garbage collection on
types with older Python versions.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Avoid loading <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tqdm</span></code> module before it’s actually used if at all
(it may get disabled by the user), speeding up the start of Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to optimize internal helpers only once and immediately,
avoiding extra global passes that were slowing down Python level
compilation by of large programs by a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to recognize the case where a module optimization can
provide no immediate change, but only after a next run, avoiding
extra global passes originating from these, that were slowing down
compilation of large programs by a lot. Together with the other
change, this can improve scalability by a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Remove implicit dependencies for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg_resources.extern</span></code>
and use aliases instead. Using one of the packages, was causing all
that might be used, to be considered as used, with some being
relatively large. This was kind of a mistake in how we supported this
so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Revamped the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eventlet</span></code> plugin, include needed DNS modules
as bytecode rather than as source code, scanning them with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkgutil</span></code> rather than filesystem, with much cleaner code in the
plugin.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id43">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id43" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removed support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pefile</span></code> dependency walker choice and inline
copy of the code. It was never as good giving incomplete results, and
after later improvements, slower, and therefore has lost the original
benefit over using Dependency Walker that is faster and more correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Added example for onefile on Windows with the version information and
with the temporary directory mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe difference in file access with onefile on Windows, where
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.argv[0]</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os.path.dirname(__file__)</span></code> will be different
things.</p></li>
<li><p>Added inline copy of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tqdm</span></code> to make sure it’s available for
progress bar output for 2.7 or higher. Recommend having it in the
Debian package.</p></li>
<li><p>Added inline copy of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">colorama</span></code> for use on Windows, where on some
terminals it will give better results with the progress bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop using old PyLint for Python2, while it would be nice to catch
errors, the burden of false alarms seems to high now.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Added even more checks on options that make no sense, made sure
to do this only after a possible restart in proper environment, so
warnings are not duplicated.</p></li>
<li><p>For Linux onefile, keep appimage outputs in case of an error, that
should help debugging it in case of issues.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Added traces for plugin provided implicit dependencies leading to
inclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>Added inline copy of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zstd</span></code> C code for use in decompression for the
Windows onefile bootstrap, not yet used though.</p></li>
<li><p>Added checks to options that accept package names for obvious
mistakes, such that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--include-package-data</span> <span class="pre">--mingw64</span></code> will not
swallow an option, as that is clearly not a package name, that would
hide that option, while also not having any intended effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Added ignore list for decision to recompile extension modules with
available source too. For now, Nuitka will not propose to recompile
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Cython</span></code> modules that are very likely not used by the program
anyway, and also not for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lxml</span></code> until it’s clear if there’s any
benefit in that. More will be added in the future, this is mostly for
cases, where Cython causes incompatibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for using abstract base classes in plugins. These are
not considered for loading, and allow nicer implementation of shared
code, e.g. between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyQt5</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PySide2</span></code> plugins, but allow e.g.
to enforce the provision of certain overloads.</p></li>
<li><p>User Manual: Remove the instruction to install <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache</span></code>, since
it’s an inline copy, this makes no sense anymore and that was
obsolete.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated PyLint to latest versions, and our requirements in general.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id44">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id44" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Started removal of PyLint annotations used for old Python2 only. This
will be a continuous action to remove these.</p></li>
<li><p>Jinja2 based static code generation for operations was cleaned up, to
avoid code for static mismatches in the result C, avoiding language
constructs like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">(1</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="pre">0)</span></code> with sometimes larger branches,
replacing it with Jinja2 branches of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{%</span> <span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">...</span> <span class="pre">%}</span></code> form.</p></li>
<li><p>Jinja2 based Python2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> code was pioniering the use of macros,
but this was expanded to allow kinds of types for binary operations,
allow their reuse for in-place operation, with these macros making
returns via goto exits rather than return statements in a function.
Landing pads for these exits can then assign target values for
in-place different from what those for binary operation result return
do.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed the interfacing of plugins with DLL dependency detection,
cleaning up the interactions considerably with more unified code, and
faster executing due to cached plugin decisons.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate manually provided slot function for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code>
into the standard static code generation. Previously parts were
generated and parts could be generated, but also provided with manual
code. The later is now all gone.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a less verbose progress bar format with less useless infos,
making it less likely to overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleanup how payload data is accessed in Windows onefile bootstrap,
preparing the addition of decompression, doing the reading from the
file in only one dedicated function.</p></li>
<li><p>When Jinja2 generated exceptions in the static code, it is now done
via proper Jinja2 macros rather than Python code, and these now avoid
useless Python version branches where possible, e.g. because a type
like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code> is already Python version specific, with the goal to
get rid of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyErr_Format</span></code> usage in our generated static code. That
goal is future work though.</p></li>
<li><p>Move safe strings helpers (cannot overflow) to a dedicated file, and
remove the partial duplication on the Windows onefile bootstrap code.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jinja2 static code generation was enhanced to track the usage of
labels used as goto targets, so that error exits, and value typed
exits from operations code no longer emitted when not used, and
therefore labels that are not used are not present.</p></li>
<li><p>For implicit dependencies, the parsing of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></code> file of a
module no longer emits a dependency on the module itself. Also from
plugins, these are now filtered away.</p></li>

<h3>Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id45" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Detect if onefile mode has required downloads and if there is user
consent, otherwise skip onefile tests in the test runner.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to also allow accesses to files via short paths on Windows if
these are allowed long paths.</p></li>
<li><p>The standalone tests on Windows didn’t actually take run time traces
and therefore were ineffective.</p></li>
<li><p>Added standalone test for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">glfw</span></code> coverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct based tests for in-place operations are now using a value
for the first time, and then a couple more times, allowing for real
in-place usage, so we are sure we measure correctly if that’s
happening.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id46" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Where the big change of the last release were optimization changes to
reduce the global passes, this release addresses remaining causes for
extra passes, that could cause these to still happen. That makes sure,
Nuitka scalability is very much enhanced in this field again.</p>
<p>The new features for forced outputs are at this time Windows only and
make a huge difference when it comes to providing a way to debug Windows
Services or programs in general without a console, i.e. a GUI program.
These will need even more specifiers, e.g. to cover program directory,
rather than exe filename only, but it’s a very good start.</p>
<p>On the tooling side, not a lot has happened, with the clcache fix, it
seems that locking issues on Windows are gone.</p>
<p>The plugin changes from previous releases had left a few of them in a
state where they were not working, but this should be restored.
Interaction with the plugins is being refined constantly, and this
releases improved again on their interfaces. It will be a while until
this becomes stable.</p>
<p>Adding support for PySide2 is a headline feature actually, but not as
perfect as we are used to in other fields. More work will be needed,
also in part with upstream changes, to get this to be fully supported.</p>
<p>For the performance side of things, the in-place work and the binary
operations work has taken proof of concept stuff done for Python2 and
applied it more universally to Python3. Until we cover all long
operations, esp. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> seems extremely important and is lacking, this
cannot be considered complete, but it gives amazing speedups in some
cases now.</p>
<p>Future releases will revisit the type tracing to make sure, we know more
about loop variables, to apply specific code helpers more often, so we
can achieve the near C speed we are looking for in the field of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code>
performance.</p>

Fixed in 0.6.11.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.9: Subscripting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type</span></code> for annotations wasn’t yet
implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.9: Better matching of types for metaclass selection, generic
aliases were not yet working, breaking some forms of type annotations
in base classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Allow selecting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--msvc-version</span></code> when a MSVC prompt is
currently activated.</p></li>

bars are enabled. Do not use `` –show-progress`` or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--verbose</span></code> as

<li><p>Plugins: Added APIs for final processing of the result and onefile
post processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: On Windows, the Python process terminates with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KeyboardInterrupt</span></code> when the user sends CTRL-break, CTRL-C,
shutdown or logoff signals.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: On Windows, in case of the launching process terminating

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id49" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid global passes caused by module specific optimization. The
variable completeness os now traced per module and function scope,
allowing a sooner usage. Unused temporary variables and closure
variables are remove immediately. Recognizing possible auto releases
of parameter variables is also instantly.</p>
<p>This should bring down current passes from 5-6 global passes to only
2 global passes in the normal case, reducing frontend compile times
in some cases massively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Better unary node handling. Dedicated nodes per operation allow for
more compact memory usage and faster optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Detect flow control and value escape for the repr of node based on
type shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced optimization of caught exception references, these never
raise or have escapes of control flow.</p></li>
<li><p>Exception matching operations are more accurately annotated, and may
be recognized to not raise in more cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">issubclass</span></code> built-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed scons caching as used on Windows entirely. We should either
be using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> automatically now.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__slots__</span></code> for all node classes. In some cases,
mixins were preventing the feature from being it. We now enforce
their correct specification of slots, which makes sure we can’t miss
it anymore. This should again gain more speed and save memory at
frontend compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Enhanced gcc version detection with improved caching behavior,
this avoids querying the same gcc binary twice.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id53" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The big changes in this release are the optimization changes to reduce
the global passes and the memory savings from other optimization. These
should again make Nuitka more scalable with large projects, but there
definitely is work remaining.</p>
<p>Adding nice stopping behaviour for the Onefile mode on Windows is
seemingly a first, and it wasn’t easy, but it will make it more reliable
to users.</p>
<p>Also tooling of gcc and MSVC on Windows got a lot more robust, covering
more cases, and macOS support has been renewed and should be a lot
better now.</p>
<p>The progress bar is a nice touch and improves the overall feel of the
compilation process, but obviously we need to aim at getting faster
overall still. For projects using large dependencies, e.g. Pandas the
compilation is still far too slow and that will need work on caching
frontend results, and better optimization and C code generation for the
backend.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.6.11<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-6-11" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release is a massive improvement in many ways with lots of bug
fixes and new features.</p>
<div class="section" id="id54">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id54" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pyi</span></code> file parser didn’t handle relative imports. Fixed
in 0.6.10.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, multiprocessing plugin was not working reliable
following of imports from the additional entry point. Fixed in
0.6.10.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Pipenv: Workaround parsing issue with our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> to allow
installation from Github. Fixed in 0.6.10.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Merging of branches in optimization could give indeterministic
results leading to more iterations than necessary. Fixed in 0.6.10.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Avoid profile powershell when attempting to resolve
symlinks. Fixed in 0.6.10.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, always check for stdin, stdout, and stderr presence.
This was so far restricted to gui mode applications, but it seems to
be necessary in other situations too. Fixed in 0.6.10.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--trace-execution</span></code> was not working for standalone
mode but can be useful for debugging. Fixed in 0.6.10.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Onefile could run into path length limits. Fixed in 0.6.10.3
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: The winlib gcc download link became broken and was updated.
Fixed in 0.6.10.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The “__main__” module was not triggering all plugin hooks,
but it needs to for completeness.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fix, symlinked Python installations on Windows were not
working, with dependency walker being unable to look into these.
Fixed in 0.6.10.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fix support for numpy on Windows and macOS, the plugin
failed to copy important DLLs. Fixed in 0.6.10.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: For versions before 3.7, the symlink resolution also needs
to be done, but wasn’t handling the bytes output yet. Fixed in
0.6.10.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, folder based inclusion would both pick up namespace folders and
modules of the same name, crashing the compilation due to conflicts.
Fixed in 0.6.10.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--lto</span></code> wasn’t used for clang on non-Windows yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the order of locals dict releases wasn’t enforced, which could
lead to differences that break caching of C files potentially. Fixed
in 0.6.10.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hash</span></code> nodes didn’t consider if their argument was raising,
even if the type of the argument was <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> and therefore the
operation should not. Fixed in 0.6.10.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, need to copy type shape and escape description for the
replacement inverted comparisons when used with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span></code>, otherwise
the compilation can crash as these are expected to be present at all
times. Fixed in 0.6.10.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, some complex constant values could be confused, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-0j</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0j</span></code>. These corner cases were not properly considered in the
constant loading code, only for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fix, bytecode only standard library modules were not
working. This is at least used with Fedora 33.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux: Fix, extension modules compiled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--lto</span></code> were not
working.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Retry if updating resources fails due to Virus checkers
keeping files locked.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Pre- and postload code of modules should not be allowed to
cause <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImportError</span></code>, as these will be invisible to the other parts
of optimization, instead make them unraisable error traces.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Adding missing import for SciPy 1.6 support.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, only export required symbols when using MinGW64 in
module mode.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="id55">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id55" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Python3.9: Added official support for this version.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Added command line options to include data files. These are
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--include-package-data</span></code> which will copy all non-DLLs and
non-Python files of package names matching the pattern given. And
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--include-data-file</span></code> takes source and relative target file paths
and copies them. For onefile this is the only way to include files,
for standalone mode they are mostly a convenience function.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Added mode where the file is unpacked to a temporary folder
before running instead of doing it to appdata.</p></li>
<li><p>Onefile: Added linux specific options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--linux-onefile-icon</span></code> to
allow provision of an icon to use in onefile mode on Linux, so far
this was only available as the hard coded path to a Python icon,
which also didn’t exist on all platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Major logging cleanup. Everything is now using our tracing
classes and even error exits go through there and are therefore
colored if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Make it easier to integrate commercial plugins, now only an
environment variable needs to point to them.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Enhanced option parsing gives notes. This complains about options
that conflict or that are implied in others. Trying to catch more
usage errors sooner.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Ignore exceptions in buggy plugin code, only warn about them
unless in debug mode, where they still crash Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: More complete scons report files, includes list values as well
and more modes used.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache</span></code> is now included and no longer used from the
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Output for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> results got improved.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang</span></code>, on Windows if present near a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcc.exe</span></code> like it is the case for some winlibs downloads, it will
be used. To use it provide <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--mingw64</span> <span class="pre">--clang</span></code> both. Without the
first one, it will mean <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clangcl.exe</span></code> which uses the MSVC compiler
as a host.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id56">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id56" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some modules had very slow load times, e.g. if they used many list
objects due to linear searches for memory deduplication of objects.
We now have dictionaries of practically all constant objects loaded,
making these more instant.</p></li>
<li><p>Use less memory at compile time due using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__slots__</span></code> for all node
types, finally figured out, how to achieve this with multiple
inheritance.</p></li>
<li><p>Use hedley for compiler macros like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unlikely</span></code> as they know best
how to do these.</p></li>
<li><p>Special case the merging of 2 branches avoiding generic code and
being much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Hard imports have better code generated, and are being optimized into
for the few standard library modules and builtin modules we handle,
they also now annotate the type shape to be module.</p></li>
<li><p>No longer annotate hard module import attribute lookups as control
flow escapes. Not present attributes are changed into static raises.
Trust for values is configured for a few values, and experimental.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid preloaded packages for modules that have no side effects and
are in the standard library, typically <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pth</span></code> files will use e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os</span></code> but that’s not needed to be preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">incbin</span></code> for including binary data through inline assembly of
the C compiler. This covers many more platforms than our previous
linker option hacks, and the fallback to generated C code. In fact
everything but Windows uses this now.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id57">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id57" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Windows: For Scons we now require a Python 3.5 or higher to be
installed to use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Removed support for gcc older than version 8. This
specifically affects CondaCC and older MinGW64 installations. Since
Nuitka can now download the MinGW64 10, there is no point in having
these and they cause issues.</p></li>
<li><p>We took over the maintenance of clcache as Nuitka/clcache which is
not yet ready for public consumption, but should become the new
source of clache in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Include an inline copy of clcache in Nuitka and use it on Windows for
MSVC and ClangCL.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed compatibility older aliases of follow option, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--recurse-*</span></code>
and require <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--follow-*</span></code> options to be used instead.</p></li>
<li><p>For pylint checking, the tool now supports a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--diff</span></code> mode where
only the changed files get checked. This is much faster and allows to
do it more often before commit.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the versions of isort and black when doing the autoformat to
avoid using outdated versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Handling missing pylint more gracefully when checking source code
quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to use the codespell tool with Python3 and make sure to
error exit when spelling problems were found, so we can use this in
Github actions too.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed Travis config, we now only use Github actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed landscape config, it doesn’t really exist anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Bumped all PyPI dependnecies to their latest versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommend ccache on Debian, as we now consider the absence of ccache
something to warn about.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The DLLs asked for by plugins that are not found are no
longer warned about.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow our checker and format tools to run on outside of tree code. We
are using that for Nuitka/clcache.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for Fedora 33 and openSUSE 15.3, as well as Ubuntu
Groovy.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Check if Windows SDK is installed for MSVC and ClangCL.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Enhanced wording in case no compiler was found. No longer
tell people how to manually install MinGW64, that is no longer
necessary and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pywin32</span></code> is not needed to detect MSVC, so it’s not
installed if not found.</p></li>
<li><p>Detect “embeddable Python” by missing include files, and reject it
with proper error message.</p></li>
<li><p>Added onefile and standalone as a use case to the manual and put also
the DLL and data files problems as typically issues.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id58">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id58" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Avoid decimal and string comparisons for Python versions checks,
these were lazy and are going to break once 3.10 surfaces. In testing
we now use tuples, in Nuitka core hexacimal values much like CPython
itself does.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop using subnode child getters and setters, and instead only use
subnode attributes. This was gradually changed so far, but in this
release all remaining uses have migrated. This should also make the
optimization stage go faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Change node constructors to not use a decorator to resolve conflicts
with builtin names, rather handle these with manual call changes, the
decorator only made it difficult to read and less performant.</p></li>
<li><p>Move safe string helpers to their own dedicated helper file, allowing
for reuse in plugin code that doesn’t want to use all of Nuitka C
helpers.</p></li>
<li><p>Added utils code for inline copy imports, as we use that for quite a
few things now.</p></li>
<li><p>Further restructured the Scons files to use more common code.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The module name objects now reject many <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> specific
APIs that ought to not be used, and the code got changed to use these
instead, leading to cleaner and more correct usages.</p></li>
<li><p>Using named tuples to specify included data files and entry points.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkgutil</span></code> in plugins to scan for modules rather than listing
directories.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id60" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release has seen Python3.9 and Onefile both being completed. The
later needs compression added on Windows, but that can be added in a
coming release, for now it’s fully functional.</p>
<p>The focus clearly has been on massive cleanups, some of which will
affect compile time performance. There is relatively little new
optimization otherwise.</p>
<p>The adoption of clcache enables a very fast caching, as it’s now loaded
directly into the Scons process, avoiding a separate process fork.</p>
<p>Generally a lot of polishing has been applied with many cleanups
lowering the technical debt. It will be interesting to see where the
hard module imports can lead us in terms of more optimization. Static
optimization of the Python version comparisons and checks is needed to
lower the amount of imports to be processed.</p>
<p>Important fixes are also included, e.g. the constants loading
performance was too slow in some cases. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multiprocessing</span></code> on
Windows and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code> plugins were regressed and finally everything
ought to be back to working fine.</p>
<p>Future work will have to aim at enhanced scalability. In some cases,
Nuitka still takes too much time to compile if projects like Pandas
include virtually everything installed as an option for it to use.</p>

<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id61" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, was memory leaking arguments of all complex call helper
functions. Fixed in 0.6.9.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Fix, the dill-compat code needs to follow API change. Fixed
in 0.6.9.7 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fixup for multiprocessing module and complex call helpers
that could crash the program. Fixed in 0.6.9.7 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the frame caching could leak memory when using caching for
functions and generators used in multiple threads.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, importing an extension module below a compiled module
was not possible in accelerated mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, keyword arguments for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open</span></code> built-in were not fully
compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the scons python check should also not accept directories,
otherwise strange misleading error will occur later.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: When Python is installed through a symbolic link, MinGW64
and Scons were having issues, added a workaround to resolve it even
on Python2.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">co_freevars</span></code> in code objects,
e.g. newer matplotlib needs this.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Add needed data files for gooey. Fixed in 0.6.9.4
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Fix, was not respecting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--quiet</span></code> option when running Scons.
Fixed in 0.6.9.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Fix, wasn’t automatically detecting Scons from promised paths.
Fixed in 0.6.9.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Fix, the clcache output parsing wasn’t robust enough. Fixed in
0.6.9.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.8: Ignore all non-strings provided in doc-string fashion,
they are not to be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getattr</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setattr</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hasattr</span></code> could not be used in
finally clauses anymore. Fixed in 0.6.9.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: For Python3 enhanced compatibility for Windows no console
mode, they need a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.stdin</span></code> or else e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input</span></code> will not be
compatible and raise <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RuntimeError</span></code>.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="id62">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id62" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added experimental support for Python 3.9, in such a way that the
CPython3.8 test suite passes now, the 3.9 suite needs investigation
still, so we might be missing new features.</p></li>
<li><p>Added experimental support for Onefile mode with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--onefile</span></code> that
uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AppImage</span></code> on Linux and our own bootstrap binary on Windows.
Other platforms are not supported at this time. With this, the
standalone folder is packed into a single binary. The Windows variant
currently doesn’t yet do any compression yet, but the Linux one does.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added downloading of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache.exe</span></code>, esp. as the other
sources so far recommended were not working properly after updates.
This is taken from the official project and should be good.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added downloading of matching MinGW64 C compiler, if no
other was found, or that was has the wrong architecture, e.g. 32 bits
where we need 64 bits.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added ability to copy icon resources from an existing binary
with new option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-icon-from-exe</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added ability to provide multiple icon files for use with
different desktop resolutions with new option
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-icon-from-ico</span></code> that got renamed to disambiguate from
other icon options.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for requesting UAC admin right with new option
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-uac-admin</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for requesting “uiaccess” rights with yet
another new option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-uac-uiaccess</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added ability to specify version info to the binary. New
options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-company-name</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-product-name</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-file-version</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-product-version</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-file-description</span></code> have been added. Some of these have
defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced support for using the Win32 compiler of MinGW64, but it’s
not perfect yet and not recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for LTO mode for MSVC as well, this seems to
allow more optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The numpy plugin now handles matplotlib3 config files
correctly.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="id63">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id63" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use less C variables in dictionary created, not one per key/value
pair. This improved scalability of C compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common code for module variable access, leading to more compact
code and enhanced scalability of C compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use error exit during dictionary creation to release the dictionary,
list, tuple, and set in case of an error occurring while they are
still under construction. That avoids releases of it in error exists,
reducing the generated code size by a lot. This improves scalability
of C compilation for generating these.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate no exception raise for local variables of classes with know
dict shape, to avoid useless error exits.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate no exception exit for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staticmethod</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">classmethod</span></code>
as they do not check their arguments at all. This makes code
generated for classes with these methods much more compact, mainly
improving their scalability in C compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>In code generation, prefer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> over <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka_bool</span></code> which allows
to annotate exception result, leading to more compact code. Also
cleanup so that code generation always go through the C type objects,
rather than doing cases locally, adding a C type for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common code for C code handling const <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> return only, to
cases where there is any immutable constant value returned, avoid
code generation for this common case. Currently mutable constants are
not handled, this may be added in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate no exception for exception type checks in handlers for
Python2 and no exception if the value has exception type shape for
Python3. The exception type shape was newly added. This avoids
useless exception handlers in most cases, where the provided
exception is just a built-in exception name.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve speed of often used compile time methods on nodes
representing constant values, by making their implementation type
specific to improve frontend compile time speed, we check e.g.
mutable and hashable a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide truth value for variable references, enhancing loop
optimization and merge value tracing, to also decide this correctly
for values only read, and then changed through attribute, e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">append</span></code> on lists. This allows many more static optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staticmethod</span></code> for methods in Nuitka nodes to achieve faster
frontend compile times where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Use dedicated helper code for calls with single argument, avoiding
the need have a call site local C array of size one, just to pass a
pointer to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Added handling of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hash</span></code> slot, to predict hashable keys for
dictionary and sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Share more slot provision for built-in type shapes from mixin
classes, to get them more universally provided, even for special
types, where their consideration is unusual.</p></li>
<li><p>Trace “user provided” flag only for constants where it really
matters, i.e. for containers and generally potentially large values,
but not for every number or boolean value.</p></li>
<li><p>Added lowering of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytearray</span></code> constant values to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code> value
iteration, while handling constant values for this optimization with
dedicated code for improved frontend compilation speed.</p></li>
<li><p>The dict built-in now annotates the dictionary type shape of its
result.</p></li>
<li><p>The wrapping side-effects node now passes on the type shape of the
wrapped value, allowing for optimization of these too.</p></li>
<li><p>Split <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slice</span></code> nodes into variants with 1, 2 or 3 arguments, to
avoid the overhead of determining which case we have, as well as to
save a bit of memory, since these are more frequently used on Python3
for subscript operations. Also annotate their type shape, allowing
more optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster dictionary lookups, esp. in cases where errors occur, because
we were manually recreating a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KeyError</span></code> that is already provided
by the dict implementation. This should also be faster, as it avoids
a CPython API call overhead on the DLL and they can provide a
reference or not for the returned value, simplifying using code.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster dictionary containment checks, with our own dedicated helper,
we can use code that won’t create an exception when an item is not
present at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster hash lookups with our own helper, separating cases where we
want an exception for non-hashable values or not. These should also
be faster to call.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid acquiring thread state in exception handling that checks if a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></code> occurred, to improved speed on Python3, where is
involves locking, but this needs to be applied way more often.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure checks to debug mode and full compatibility mode are done
with the variables introduced, to avoid losing performance due to
calls for Nuitka compile time enhancements. This was so far only done
partially.</p></li>
<li><p>Split constant references into two base classes, only one of them
tracking if the value was provided by the user. This saves compile
time memory and avoids the overhead to check if sizes are exceeded in
cases they cannot possibly be so.</p></li>
<li><p>The truth value of container creations is now statically known,
because the empty container creation is no longer a possibility for
these nodes, allowing more optimization for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize the bool built-in with no arguments directory, allow to
simplify the node for single argument form to avoid checks if an
argument was given.</p></li>
<li><p>Added iteration handles for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xrange</span></code> values, and make them faster
to create by being tied to the node type, avoiding shared types,
instead using the mixin approach. This is in preparation to using
them for standard iterator tracing as well. So far they are only used
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">any</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">all</span></code> decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Added detection if a iterator next can raise, using existing iterator
checking which allows to remove needless checks and exception traces.
Adding a code variant for calls to next that cannot fail, while
tuning the code used for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next</span></code> and unpacking next, to use faster
exception checking in the C code. This will speed up unpacking
performance for some forms of unpacking from known sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to use the fastest tuple API possible in all of Nuitka,
many place e.g. used <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyTuple_Size</span></code>, and one was in a performance
critical part, e.g. in code that used when compiled functions as
called as a method.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimized variant for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_PyList_Extend</span></code> for slightly faster
unpacking code.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimized variant for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyList_Append</span></code> for faster list
contractions code.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RemoveFileSpec</span></code> and instead provide our own code for
that task, slightly reducing file size and avoiding to use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Shlapi</span></code> link library.</p></li>

<h3>Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id64" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Made reflected test use common cleanup of test folder, which is more
robust against Windows locking issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Only output changed CPython output after the forced update of cached
value was done, avoiding duplicate or outdated outputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid complaining about exceptions for in-place operations in case
they are lowered to non-inplace operations and then raise
unsupported, not worth the effort to retain original operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Added generated test for subscript operations, also expanding
coverage in generated tests by making sure, conditional paths are
both taken by varying the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cond</span></code> value.</p></li>
<li><p>Use our own code helper to check if an object has an attribute, which

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id65" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure that code generation always go through the C type objects
rather than local <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elif</span></code> casing of the type. This required cleaning
up many of the methods and making code more abstract.</p></li>
<li><p>Added base class for C types without reference counting, so they can
share the code that ignores their handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getConstant</span></code> for constant value nodes, use the more general
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getCompileTimeConstant</span></code> instead, and provide quick methods that
test for empty tuple or dict, to use for checking concrete values,
e.g. with call operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Unified container creation into always using a factory function, to
be sure that existing container creations are not empty.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;calledWithBuiltinArgumentNamesDecorator</span></code> where
possible, and instead make explicit wrapping or use correct names.
This was used to allow e.g. an argument named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> to be passed
from built-in optimization, but that can be done in a cleaner
fashion. Also aligned no attributes and the argument names, there was
inconsistency there.</p></li>
<li><p>Name mangling was done differently for attribute names and normal
names and with non-shared code, and later than necessary, removing
this as a step from variable closure taking after initial tree build.</p></li>
<li><p>As part of the icon changes, now handled in Python code, we stop
using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rc</span></code> binary and handle all resources ourselves, allowing
to remove that code from the Scons side of things.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved file comparison code of standalone mode into file utils
function for use in plugins as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Unified how path concatenation is done in Nuitka helper code, there
were more or less complete variants, this is making sure, the most
capable form is used in all cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Massive cleanup to our scons file, by moving out util code that only
scons uses, hacks we apply to speed up scons, and more to separate
modules with dedicated interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>When using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enumerate</span></code> we now provide start value of 1 where it is
appropriate, e.g. when counting source code lines, rather than adding
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">count+1</span></code> on every usage, making code more readable.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id67" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This is the big release in terms of scalability. The optimization in
this release mostly focused on getting things that cause increased
compile times sorted out. A very important fix avoids loop optimization
to leak into global passes of all modules unnecessarily, but just as
important, generated code now is much better for the C compiler to
consume in observed problematic cases.</p>
<p>More optimization changes are geared towards reducing Nuitka frontend
compile time, which could also be a lot in some cases, ending up
specializing more constant nodes and how they expose themselves to
optimization.</p>
<p>Other optimization came from supporting Python 3.9 and things come
across during the implementation of that feature, e.g. to be able to
make differences with unpacking error messages, we provide more code to
handle it ourselves, and to manually optimize how to interact with e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> objects.</p>
<p>For Windows, the automatic download of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> and a matching MinGW64
if none was found, is a new step, that should lower the barrier of entry
for people who have no clue what a C compiler is. More changes are bound
to come in this field with future releases, e.g. making a minimum
version requirement for gcc on Windows that excludes unfit C compilers.</p>
<p>All in all, this release should be taken as a major cleanup, resolving
many technical debts of Nuitka and preparing more optimization to come.</p>

addressed as hotfixes, and other issues were even very involved, causing
many changes to be necessary.</p>
<p>There are also many general improvements and performance work for

<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id68" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, loop optimization sometimes didn’t determinate, effectively
making Nuitka run forever, with no indication why. This has been
fixed and a mechanism to give up after too many attempts has been
added.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, closure taking object allowed a brief period where the garbage
collector was exposed to uninitialized objects. Fixed in 0.6.8.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6+: Fix corruption for exceptions thrown into asyncgen. Fixed
in 0.6.8.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, deleting variables detected as C type bool could raise an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnboundLocalError</span></code> that was wrong. Fixed in 0.6.8.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.8.3+: Fix, future annotations parsing was using hard coded
values that were changed in CPython, leading to errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Avoid encoding issues for Python3 on more systems, by going
from wide characters to unicode strings more directly, avoiding an
encoding as UTF8 in the middle. Fixed in 0.6.8.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Do not crash when warning about uninstalled MSVC using
Python3. This is a Scons bug that we fixed. Fixed in 0.6.8.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: The output of dependency walker should be considered as
“latin1” rather than UTF8. Fixed in 0.6.8.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added missing hidden dependencies for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">flask</span></code>. Fixed in
0.6.8.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fixed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win32com.client</span></code> on Windows. Fixed in 0.6.8.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkgutil</span></code> to scan encoding modules, properly
ignoring the same files as Python does in case of garbage files being
there. Fixed in 0.6.8.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Enabling a plugin after the filename to compile was given,
didn’t allow for arguments to the passed, causing problems. Fixed in
0.6.8.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">certifi</span></code> data file is now supported for all
modules using it and not only some.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: The bytecode for the standard library had filenames
pointing to the original installation attached. While these were not
used, but replaced at runtime, they increased the size of the binary,
and leaked information.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: The path of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> was not None, but pointing
to the original executable, which could also point to some temporary
virtualenv directory and therefore not exist, also it was leaking
information about the original install.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: With the MSVC compiler, elimination of duplicate strings was
not active, causing even unused strings to be present in the binary,
some of which contained file paths of the Nuitka installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for pyglet.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The command line handling for Pmw plugin was using wrong
defaults, making it include more code than necessary, and to crash if
it was not there.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id70" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

unnecessary states for traces, that we don’t use anymore.</p></li>

MinGW64. This avoids a performance loss doing something that will
then end up being unused.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id73" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The main focus of this release has been bug fixes with only a little
performance work due to the large amount of regressions and other
findings from the last release.</p>
<p>The new constants loading for removes a major scalability problem. The
checked and now consistently possible use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache</span></code>
allows for much quicker recompilation. Nuitka itself can still be slow
in some cases, but should have seen some improvements too. Scalability
will have to remain a focus for the next releases too.</p>
<p>The other focus, was to make the binaries contain no original path
location, which is interesting for standalone mode. Nuitka should be
very good in this area now.</p>
<p>For optimization, the new loop code is again better. But it was also
very time consuming, to redo it, yet again. This has prevented other
optimization to be added.</p>
<p>And then for correctness, the locals scope work, while very invasive,
was necessary, to handle the usage of locals inside of contractions, but
also will be instrumental for function inlining to become generally
available.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, this release is a necessary intermediate step. Upcoming
releases will be able to focus more clearly on run time performance
again as well as on scalability for generated C code.</p>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id76" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Proper loop SSA capable of detecting shapes with an incremental
initial phase and a final result of alternatives for variables
written in the loop. This detects shapes of manual integer
incrementing loops correctly now, it doesn’t see through iterators
yet, but this will come too.</p></li>
<li><p>Added type shapes for all operations and all important built-in types
to allow more compile time optimization and better target type
selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Target type code generation was expanded from manual usage with
conditions to all operations allowing to get at bool target values
more directly.</p></li>
<li><p>For in-place operations, there is the infrastructure to generate them
for improved performance, but so far it’s only used for Python2 int,
and not for the many types normal operations are supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Force usage of C boolean type for all indicator variables from the
re-formulation. In some cases, we are not yet there with detections,
and this gives instant benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Complex constants didn’t annotate their type shape, preventing
compile time optimization for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.8: Also support vectorcall for compiled method objects. These
are rarely used in new Python, but can make a difference.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove loops that have only a final break. This happens in static
optimization in some cases, and allows more optimization to be done.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using a preparing a constant tuple value for calls with only
constant arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyErr_Format</span></code> where it’s not necessary by adding
specialized helpers for common cases.</p></li>

generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable recursion checks outside of full compat mode.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id80" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is huge in terms of bugs fixed, but also extremely
important, because the new loop SSA and type tracing, allows for many
more specialized code usages. We now can trace the type for some loops
to be specifically an integer or long value only, and will become able
to generate code that avoids using Python objects, in these cases.</p>
<p>Once that happens, the performance will make a big jump. Future releases
will have to consolidate the current state, but it is expected that at
least an experimental addition of C type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span> <span class="pre">long</span></code> can be
added, add to that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iterator</span></code> type shape and value analsis, and an
actual jump in performance can be expected.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.6.7<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-6-7" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release contains bug fixes and improvements to the packaging, for
the RPM side as well as for Debian, to cover Python3 only systems as
they are now becoming more common.</p>
<div class="section" id="id81">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id81" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Compatibility: The value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__module__</span></code> for extension modules was
not dependent into which package the module was loaded, it now is.</p></li>
<li><p>Anaconda: Enhanced detection of Anaconda for Python 3.6 and higher.</p></li>
<li><p>CentOS6: Detect gcc version to allow saving on macro memory usage,
very old gcc didn’t have that.</p></li>
<li><p>Include Python3 for all Fedora versions where it works as well as for
openSUSE versions 15 and higher.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Using short path names to interact with Scons avoids
problems with unicode paths in all cases.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: The usage of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">install_name_tool</span></code> could sometimes fail due to
length limits, we now increase it at link time.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Do not link against <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libpython</span></code> for module mode. This
prevented extension modules from actually being usable.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6: Follow coroutine fixes in our asyncgen implementation as
well.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, our version number handling could overflow with minor versions
past 10, so we limited it for now.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id82">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id82" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support for Python 3.8, the experimental was already there and
pretty good, but now added the last obscure features too.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins can now provide C code to be included in the compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Added targets <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build_nuitka</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">install_nuitka</span></code> to
complement <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bdist_nuitka</span></code>, so we support software other than
wheels, e.g. RPM packaging that compiles with Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lldb</span></code> the Clang debugger with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--debugger</span></code>
mode.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id83">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id83" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make the file prefix map actually work for gcc and clang, and compile
files inside the build folder, unless we are running in debugger
mode, so we use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code> caching across different compilations for
at least the static parts.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid compilation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__frozen.c</span></code> in accelerated mode, it’s not
used.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer using the inline copy of scons over systems scons. The later
will only be slower. Use the fallback to external scons only from the
Debian packages, since there we consider it forbidden to include
software as a duplicate.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="id84">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id84" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added recommended plugins for Visual Code, replacing the list in the
Developer Manual.</p></li>
<li><p>Added repository for Fedora 30 for download.</p></li>
<li><p>Added repository for CentOS 8 for download.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated inline copy of Scons used for Python3 to 3.1.2, which is said
to be faster for large compilations.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed Eclipse setup from the manual, it’s only infererior at this
point and we do not use it ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian: Stop recommending PyQt5 in the package, we no longer use it
for built-in GUI that was removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian: Bumped the standards version and modernized the packaging,
solving a few warnings during the build.</p></li>

<h3>Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id86" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added tests to Github Actions, for the supported Python versions for
all of Linux, macOS and Windows, covering the later publicly for the
first time. We use Anaconda on macOS for the tests now, rather than
Homebrew.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable IO encoding to make sure we use UTF8 for more test suites that
actually need it in case of problems.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id87" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release adds full support for Python 3.8 finally, which took us a
while, and it cleans up a lot on the packaging side. There aren’t that
many important bug fixes, but it’s still nice to this cleaned up.</p>
<p>We have important actual optimization in the pipeline that will apply
specialization to target types and for comparison operations. We expect
to see actual performance improvements in the next release again.</p>

<p>This release contains huge amounts of crucial bug fixes all across the
board. There is also new optimization and many organisational
improvements.</p>
<div class="section" id="id88">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id88" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, the top level module must not be bytecode. Otherwise we end up
violating the requirement for an entry point on the C level.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, avoid optimizing calls with default values used. This is not yet
working and needed to be disabled for now.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, missing keyword only arguments were not enforced to be
provided keyword only, and were not giving the compatible error
message when missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Find <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win32com</span></code> DLLs too, even if they live in sub folders
of site-packages, and otherwise not found. They are used by other
DLLs that are found.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fixup for problem with standard library module in most
recent Anaconda versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Fix, was using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CXXFLAGS</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CPPFLAGS</span></code> even for the C
compiler, which is wrong, and could lead to compilation errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--clang</span></code> limited to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-cl.exe</span></code> as using it
inside a MinGW64 is not currently supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lib2to2.pgen</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added paths used by openSUSE to the Tcl/Tk plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6+: Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__main__</span></code> package was <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>, but should be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;&quot;</span></code> which allows relative imports from itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Fix, compile time optimization of floor division was using
normal division.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, some run time operations with known type shapes, were
falsely reporting error message with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code>, which
is of course not compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, was caching parent package, but these could be replaced e.g. due
to bytecode demotion later, causing crashes during their
optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__compiled__</span></code> could be corrupted when being
deleted, which some modules wrappers do.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__package__</span></code> could be corrupted when being
deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Make sure we can always output the compiler output, even if it
has a broken encoding. This should resolve MSVC issues on non-English
systems, e.g. German or Chinese.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Support for newest <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sklearn</span></code> was added.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Added resolver for run time variables in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">otool</span></code> output,
that gets PyQt5 to work on it again.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, floor division of run time calculations with float values should
not result in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code>, but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> values instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Enhanced support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">boto3</span></code> data files.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">osgeo</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gdal</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fix, there were issues with spurious errors attaching the
constants blob to the binary due to incorrect C types provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Fix, need to allow <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code> as separator for package names
too.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6+: Fix reference losses in asyncgen when throwing exceptions
into them.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dill</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-image</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skimage</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">weasyprint</span></code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytz</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytzdata</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flags=no_docstrings</span></code> no longer implies disabling the
assertions.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="id89">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id89" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added experimental support for Python 3.8, there is only very few
things missing for full support.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Added support for packages that are in a namespace and not
just top level.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Added support for single modules, not only packages, by
supporting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">py_modules</span></code> as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Added support for distinct namespaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Compare Python and C compiler architecture for MSVC too, and
catch the most common user error of mixing 32 and 64 bits.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: Output variables used from the outside, so the debugging is
easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Detect if clang installed inside MSVC automatically and use
it if requested via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--clang</span></code> option. This is only the 32 bits
variant, but currently the easy way to use it on Windows with Nuitka.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id90">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id90" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Loop variables were analysed, but results were only available on the
inside of the loop, preventing many optimization in these cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">abs</span></code> built-in, which is also a
numerical operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">all</span></code> built-in, adding a new concept of
iteration handle, for efficient checking that avoids looking at very
large sequences, of which properties can still be known.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100000</span><span class="p">))</span>  <span class="c1"># no need to look at all of them</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added support for optimizing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImportError</span></code> construction with
keyword-only arguments. Previously only used without these were
optimized.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added manual specialization for single argument calls, sovling a
TODO, as these will be very frequent.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory: Use single child form of node class where possible, the
general class now raises an error if used with used with only one
child name, this will use less memory at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory: Avoid list for non-local declarations in every function,
these are very rare, only have it if absolutely necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate more compact code for potential <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NameError</span></code> exceptions
being raised. These are very frequent, so this improves scalability
with large files.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Annotate comparison of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code>
types as not raising an exception.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared empty body functions and generators.</p>
<p>One shared implementation for all empty functions removes that burden
from the C compiler, and from the CPU instruction cache. All the
shared C code does is to release its arguments, or to return an empty
generator function in case of generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Memory: Added support for automatic releases of parameter variables
from the node tree. These are normally released in a try finally
block, however, this is now handled during code generation for much
more compact C code generated.</p></li>
<li><p>Added specialization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> operations <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added dedicated nodes for representing and optimizing based on shapes
for all binary operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable gcc macro tracing unless in debug mode, to save memory during
the C compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>Restored Python2 fast path for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> with unknown object types,
restoring performance for these.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id91">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id91" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use dedicated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ModuleName</span></code> type that makes the tests that check if
a given module name is inside a namespace as methods. This was hard
to get right and as a result, adopting this fixed a few bugs and or
inconsistent results.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.PostProcessing</span></code> to cover all actions
needed to get a runnable binary. This includes using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">install_name_tool</span></code> on macOS standalone, as well copying the Python
DLL for acceleration mode, cleaning the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> bit for module mode.
Previously only a part of these lived there.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid including the definitions of dynamically created helper
functions in the C code, instead just statically declare the ones
expected to be there. This resolves Visual Code complaining about it,
and should make life also easier for the compiler and caches like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create more helper code in closer form to what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-format</span></code> does,
so they are easier to compare to the static forms. We often create
hard coded variants for few arguments of call functions, and generate
them for many argument variations.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved setter/getter methods for Nuitka nodes consistently to the
start of the node class definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate C code much closer to what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-format</span></code> would change it
to be.</p></li>
<li><p>Unified calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">install_name_tool</span></code> on macOS into one function that
takes care of all the things, including e.g. making the file
writable.</p></li>
<li><p>Debug output from scons should be more consistent and complete now.</p></li>
<li><p>Sort files for compilation in scons for better reproducible results.</p></li>
<li><p>Create code objects version independent, avoiding python version
checks by pre-processor, hiding new stuff behind macros, that ignore
things on older Python versions.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="id92">
<h3>Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id92" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added many more built-in tests for increased coverage of the newly
covered ones, some of them being generic tests that allow to test all
built-ins with typical uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Many tests have become more PyLint clean as a result of work with
Visual Code and it complaining about them.</p></li>
<li><p>Added test to check PyPI health of top 50 packages. This is a major
GSoC 2019 result.</p></li>
<li><p>Output the standalone directory contents for Windows too in case of a
failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Added generated tests to fully cover operations on different type
shapes and their errors as well as results for typical values.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for testing against installed version of Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleanup up tests, merging those for only Python 3.2 with 3.3 as we no

optimized C code.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate code for some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CLONG</span></code> operations in preparation of

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id101" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is huge again. Main points are compatibility fixes, esp. on
the coroutine side. These have become apparently very compatible now and
we might eventually focus on making them better.</p>
<p>Again, GSoC 2019 is also showing effects, and will definitely continue
to do soin the next release.</p>
<p>Many use cases have been improved, and on an organisational level, the
adoption of Visual Studio Code seems an huge improvement to have a well
configured IDE out of the box too.</p>
<p>In upcoming releases, more built-ins will be optimized, and hopefully
the specialization of operations will hit more and more code with more
of the infrastructure getting there.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.6.4<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-6-4" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release contains many bug fixes all across the board. There is also
new optimization and many organisational improvements.</p>
<div class="section" id="id102">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id102" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When linking very large programs or packages, with gcc compiler,
Scons can produce commands that are too large for the OS. This
happens sooner on the Windows OS, but also on Linux. We now have a
workaround that avoids long command lines by using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;sources.tmp</span></code>
syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Remove temporary module after its use, instead of keeping
it in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.modules</span></code> where e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Quart</span></code> code tripped over its
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__file__</span></code> value that is illegal on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed non-usage of our enhanced detection of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcc</span></code> version for
compilers if given as a full path.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed non-detection of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gnu-cc</span></code> as a form of gcc compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.4: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__spec__</span></code> value corrections for compiled modules
was not taking into account that there was a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__spec__</span></code> value,
which can happen if something is wrapping imported modules.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added implicit dependencies for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">passlib</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added workaround for OS command line length limit in
compilation with MinGW64.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Revive the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enum</span></code> plugin, there are backports of the buggy
code it tries to patch up.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fixup handling of SxS with non zero language id, these occur
e.g. in Anaconda.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Handle multiple PyQt plugin paths, e.g. on openSUSE this is
done, also enhanced finding that path with Anaconda on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multiprocessing</span></code> on Windows, allow the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.exe</span></code>
suffix to not be present, which can happen when ran from command
line.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Better version checks for DLLs on Python3, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></code>
helper code needs more definitions to work properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pycryptodome</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pycryptodomex</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chr</span></code> built-in was not giving fully compatible error on
non number input.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id</span></code> built-in doesn’t raise an exception, but said
otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Proper C identifiers for names that fit into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">latin-1</span></code>,
but are not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ascii</span></code> encodings.</p></li>

architecture against Python from another. We now check those and
compare it, and if they do not match, inform the user directly.

errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Distutils: Using setuptools and its runners works now too, not merely
only pure distutils.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id108" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Again this release is a sign of increasing adoption of Nuitka. The GSoC
2019 is also showing effects, definitely will in the next release.</p>
<p>This release has a lot of new optimization, called specialization, but
for it to really used, in many instances, we need to get away from
working on C types for variables only, and get to them beig used for
expressions more often. Otherwise much of the new special code is not
used for most code.</p>
<p>The focus of this release has been again to open up development further
and to incorporate findings from users. The number of fixes or new use
cases working is astounding.</p>
<p>In upcoming releases, new built-ins will be optimized, and
specialization of operations will hit more and more code now that the

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id120" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is a sign of increasing adoption of Nuitka. The GSoC 2019
is showing early effects, as is more developers joining the effort.
These are great times for Nuitka.</p>
<p>This release has not much on the optimization side that is user visible,
but the work that has begun is capable of producing glorious benchmarks
once it will be finished.</p>
<p>The focus on this and coming releases is definitely to open up the
Nuitka development now that people are coming in as permanent or
temporary contributors in (relatively) high numbers.</p>

<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id121" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, the options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--[no]follow-import-to=package_name</span></code> was supposed
to not follow into the given package, but the check was executed too
broadly, so that e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package_name2</span></code> was also affected. Fixed in
0.6.0.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, wasn’t detecting multiple recursions into the same package in
module mode, when attempting to compile a whole sub-package. Fixed in
0.6.0.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, constant values are used as C boolean values still for some of
the cases. Fixed in 0.6.0.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, referencing a function cannot raise an exception, but that was
not annotated. Fixed in 0.6.0.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Use standard include of C bool type instead of rolling our
own, which was not compatible with newest Clang. Fixed in 0.6.0.3
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code> built-in type actually does have a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__float__</span></code> slot. Fixed in 0.6.0.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.7: Types that are also sequences still need to call the
method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__class_getitem__</span></code> for consideration. Fixed in 0.6.0.4
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.7: Error exits from program exit could get lost on Windows
due to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__spec__</span></code> handling not preserving errors. Fixed in 0.6.0.4
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Negative exit codes from Nuitka, e.g. due to a triggered
assertion in debug mode were not working. Fixed in 0.6.0.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, conditional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> expressions were mis-optimized when not used
to not execute the right hand side still. Fixed in 0.6.0.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6: Fix, generators, coroutines, and asyncgen were not
properly supporting annotations for local variables. Fixed in 0.6.0.5
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.7: Fix, class declarations had memory leaks that were
untestable before 3.7.1 fixed reference count issues in CPython.
Fixed in 0.6.0.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.7: Fix, asyncgen expressions can be created in normal
functions without an immediate awaiting of the iterator. This new
feature was not correctly supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, star imports on the module level should disable built-in name
optimization except for the most critical ones, otherwise e.g. names
like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">all</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pow</span></code> can become wrong. Previous workarounds for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pow</span></code> were not good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the scons for Python3 failed to properly report build errors due
to a regression of the Scons version used for it. This would mask
build errors on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.4: Fix, packages didn’t indicate that they are packages in
their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__spec__</span></code> value, causing issues with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib_resources</span></code>
module.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.4: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__spec__</span></code> values of compiled modules didn’t have
compatible <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">origin</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">has_location</span></code> values preventing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importlib_resources</span></code> module from working to load data files.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, packages created from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pth</span></code> files were also considered when
checking for sub-packages of a module.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Handle cases of conflicting DLLs better. On Windows pick
the newest file version if different, and otherwise just report and
pick randomly because we cannot really decide which ought to be
loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Warn about collisions of DLLs on non-Windows only as this
can happen with wheels apparently.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: For Windows Python extension modules <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.pyd</span></code> files,
remove the SxS configuration for cases where it causes problems, not
needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> statement on file handles was not using the proper
filename when compiling, therefore breaking e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspect.getsource</span></code> on functions defined there.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for OpenGL platform plugins to be included
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added missing implicit dependency for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zmq</span></code> module.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.7: Fix, using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-X</span> <span class="pre">utf8</span></code> flag on the calling
interpreter, aka <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=utf8_mode</span></code> was not preserved in the

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id126" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This addresses even more corner cases not working correctly, the out of
the box experience should be even better now.</p>
<p>The push towards C level performance for integer operation was held up
by the realization that loop SSA was not yet there really, and that it
had to be implemented, which of course now makes a huge difference for
the cases where e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> are being used. There is no C type for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> used yet, which limits the impact of optimization to only taking
shortcuts for the supported types. These are useful and faster of
course, but only building blocks for what is to come.</p>
<p>Most of the effort went into specialized helpers that e.g. add a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> and and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> value in a dedicated fashion, as well as
comparison operations, so we can fully operate some minimal examples
with specialized code. This is too limited still, and must be applied to
ever more operations.</p>
<p>What’s more is that the benchmarking situation has not improved. Work
will be needed in this domain to make improvements more demonstrable. It
may well end up being the focus for the next release to improve Nuitka
speedcenter to give more fine grained insights across minor changes of
Nuitka and graphs with more history.</p>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id128" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

<li><p>Windows: It’s now possible to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-cl.exe</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code> with
Nuitka as a third compiler on Windows, but it requires an existing
MSVC install to be used for resource compilation and linking.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ccache.exe</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clcache.exe</span></code>,
so that object files can now be cached for re-compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>For debug mode, report missing in-place helpers. These kinds of

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id133" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks a point, from which on performance improvements are

for expressions that are done, but not used, that is scheduled for the
next release.</p>
<p>Although there will be a need to also adapt optimization to take full
advantage of it, progress should be quick from here. There is a lot of
ground to cover, with more C types to come, and all of them needing
specialized helpers. But as soon as e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> are covered,
many more programs are going to benefiting from this.</p>

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></code>. Fixed in 0.5.32.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 3.5: Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">await</span></code> expressions didn’t annotate their
exception exit. Fixed in 0.5.32.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enum</span></code> module usages with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__new__</span></code> in derived
classes were not working, due to our automatic <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staticmethod</span></code>
decoration. Turns out, that was only needed for Python2 and can be
removed, making enum work all the way. Fixed in 0.5.32.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, recursion into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__main__</span></code> was done and could lead to compiler
crashes if the main module was named like that. This is not
prevented. Fixed in 0.5.32.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: The name for list contraction’s frames was wrong all along
and not just changed for 3.7, so drop that version check on it. Fixed
in 0.5.32.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the hashing of code objects has creating a key that could
produce more overlaps for the hash than necessary. Using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C1</span></code> on
line 29 and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code> on line 129, was considered the same. And that is
what actually happened. Fixed in 0.5.32.3 already.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Various fixes for newer Xcode versions to work as well. Fixed
in 0.5.32.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, the default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__annotations__</span></code> was the empty dict and
could be modified, leading to severe corruption potentially. Fixed in
0.5.32.4 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: When an exception is thrown into a generator that currently
does a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yield</span> <span class="pre">from</span></code> is not to be normalized.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Some exception handling cases of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yield</span> <span class="pre">from</span></code> were leaking
references to objects. Fixed in 0.5.32.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Nested namespace packages were not working unless the
directory continued to exist on disk. Fixed in 0.5.32.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Do not include <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">icuuc.dll</span></code> which is a system DLL. Fixed
in 0.5.32.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added hidden dependency of newer version of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sip</span></code>.
Fixed in 0.5.32.5 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Do not copy file permissions of DLLs and extension
modules as that makes deleting and modifying them only harder. Fixed
in 0.5.32.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: The multiprocessing plugin was not always properly patching
the run time for all module loads, made it more robust. Fixed in
0.5.32.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Do not preserve permissions of copied DLLs, which can
cause issues with read-only files on Windows when later trying to
overwrite or remove files.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.4: Make sure to disconnect finished generators from their
frames to avoid potential data corruption. Fixed in 0.5.32.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Make sure to disconnect finished coroutines from their
frames to avoid potential data corruption. Fixed in 0.5.32.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6: Make sure to disconnect finished asyncgen from their
frames to avoid potential data corruption. Fixed in 0.5.32.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Explicit frame closes of frames owned by coroutines could
corrupt data. Fixed in 0.5.32.7 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6: Explicit frame closes of frames owned by asyncgen could
corrupt data. Fixed in 0.5.32.7 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 3.4: Fix threaded imports by properly handling
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_initializing</span></code> in compiled modules <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__spec__</span></code> attributes. Before
it happen that another thread attempts to use an unfinished module.
Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--include-module</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--include-package</span></code> were
present but not visible in the help output. Fixed in 0.5.32.8
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: The multiprocessing plugin failed to properly pass compiled
functions. Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, optimization for in-place operations on mapping values
are not allowed and had to be disabled. Fixed in 0.5.32.8 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 3.5: Fixed exception handling with coroutines and asyncgen
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">throw</span></code> to not corrupt exception objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 3.7: Added more checks to class creations that were missing
for full compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Smarter hashing of unicode values avoids increased memory
usage from cached converted forms in debug mode.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id140" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is huge in many ways.</p>
<p>First, finishing “goto generators” clears an old scalability problem of
Nuitka that needed to be addressed. No more do
generators/coroutines/asyncgen consume too much memory, but instead they
become as lightweight as they ought to be.</p>
<p>Second, the use of variable declarations carying type information all
through the code generation, is an important pre-condition for “C types”
work to resume and become possible, what will be 0.6.0 and the next
release.</p>
<p>Third, the improved generator performance will be removing a lot of
cases, where Nuitka wasn’t as fast, as its current state not using “C
types” yet, should allow. It is now consistently faster than CPython for
everything related to generators.</p>
<p>Fourth, the fibers were a burden for the debugging and linking of Nuitka
on various platforms, as they provided deprecated interfaces or not. As
they are now gone, Nuitka ought to definitely work on any platform where
Python works.</p>
<p>From here on, C types work can take it, and produce the results we are
waiting for in the next major release cycle that is about to start.</p>
<p>Also the amount of fixes for this release has been incredibly high. Lots
of old bugs esp. for coroutines and asyncgen have been fixed, this is
not only faster, but way more correct. Mainly due to the easier
debugging and interface to the context code, bugs were far easier to
avoid and/or find.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.5.32<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-5-32" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release contains substantial new optimization, bug fixes, and
already the full support for Python 3.7. Among the fixes, the enhanced
coroutine work for compatibility with uncompiled ones is most important.</p>
<div class="section" id="id141">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id141" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, was optimizing write backs of attribute in-place assignments
falsely.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, generator stop future was not properly supported. It is now the
default for Python 3.7 which showed some of the flaws.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__qualname__</span></code> of coroutines and asyncgen was wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Fix, for dictionary unpackings to calls, check the keys if
they are string values, and raise an exception if not.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.6: Fix, need to check assignment unpacking for too short
sequences, we were giving <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IndexError</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ValueError</span></code>
for these. Also the error messages need to consider if they should
refer to “at least” in their wording.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, outline nodes were cloned more than necessary, which would
corrupt the code generation if they later got removed, leading to a
crash.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Compiled coroutines awaiting uncompiled coroutines was not
working properly for finishing the uncompiled ones. Also the other
way around was raising a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RuntimeError</span></code> when trying to pass an
exception to them when they were already finished. This should
resolve issues with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">asyncio</span></code> module.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, side effects of a detected exception raise, when they had an
exception detected inside of them, lead to an infinite loop in
optimization. They are now optimized in-place, avoiding an extra step
later on.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id143" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Delay creation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></code> exception in generator code for
as long as possible. This gives more compact code for generations,
which now pass the return values via compiled generator attribute for
Python 3.3 or higher.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: More immediate re-formulation of classes with no bases.
Avoids noise during optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: For class dictionaries that are only assigned from values
without side effects, they are not converted to temporary variable
usages, allowing the normal SSA based optimization to work on them.
This leads to constant values for class dictionaries of simple
classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit cleanup of nodes, variables, and local scopes that become
unused, has been added, allowing for breaking of cyclic dependencies
that prevented memory release.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id145" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removed remaining code that was there for 3.2 support. All uses of
version comparisons with 3.2 have been adapted. For us, Python3 now
means 3.3, and we will not work with 3.2 at all. This removed a fair
bit of complexity for some things, but not all that much.</p></li>
<li><p>Have dedicated file for import released helpers, so they are easier
to find if necessary. Also do not have code for importing a name in
the header file anymore, not performance relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable Python warnings when running scons. These are particularly
given when using a Python debug binary, which is happening when
Nuitka is run with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-debug</span></code> option and the inline copy of
Scons is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a factory function for all conditional statement nodes created.
This solved a TODO and handles the creation of statement sequences
for the branches as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Split class reformulation into two files, one for Python2 and one for
Python3 variant. They share no code really, and are too confusing in
a single file, for the huge code bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>Locals scopes now have a registry, where functions and classes
register their locals type, and then it is created from that.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a dedicated helper function for single argument calls in static
code that does not require an array of objects as an argument.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id147" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This releases has this important step to add conversion of locals
dictionary usages to temporary variables. It is not yet done everywhere
it is possible, and the resulting temporary variables are not yet
propagated in the all the cases, where it clearly is possible. Upcoming
releases ought to achieve that most Python2 classes will become to use a
direct dictionary creation.</p>
<p>Adding support for Python 3.7 is of course also a huge step. And also
this happened fairly quickly and soon after its release. The generic
classes it adds were the only real major new feature. It breaking the
internals for exception handling was what was holding back initially,
but past that, it was really easy.</p>
<p>Expect more optimization to come in the next releases, aiming at both
the ability to predict Python3 metaclasses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__prepare__</span></code> results, and
at more optimization applied to variables after they became temporary
variables.</p>

<li><p>Plugins: The sensible plugin list for PyQt now includes that
platforms plugins on Windows too, as they are kind of mandatory.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, for uninstalled Python versions wheels that linked

not found.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Prefer DLLs used by main program binary over ones used by
wheels.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: For DLLs added by Nuitka plugins, add the package
directory to the search path for dependencies where they might live.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vars</span></code> built-in didn’t annotate its exception exit.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">complex</span></code> built-ins needs to be
treated as a slot too.</p></li>

exception exit should be created. This prevented <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tkinter</span></code>
compilation.</p></li>

<li><p>Python3.5: Added support for cyclic imports. Now a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">from</span></code> import
with a name can really cause an import to happen, not just a module
attribute lookup.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hasattr</span></code> was never raising exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytearray</span></code> constant values were considered to be

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id150" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Apply value tracing to local dict variables too, enhancing the
optimization for class bodies and function with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> statements
by a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Better optimization for “must not have value”, wasn’t considering
merge traces of uninitialized values, for which this is also the
case.</p></li>
<li><p>Use 10% less memory at compile time due to specialized base classes
for statements with a single child only allowing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__slots__</span></code> usage
by not having multiple inheritance for those.</p></li>
<li><p>More immediately optimize branches with known truth values, so that
merges are avoided and do not prevent trace based optimization before
the pass after the next one. In some cases, optimization based on
traces could fail to be done if there was no next pass caused by
other things.</p></li>
<li><p>Much faster handling for functions with a lot of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eval</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Static optimization of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type</span></code> with known type shapes, the value is
predicted at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize containers for all compile time constants into constant
nodes. This also enables further compile time checks using them, e.g.
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isinstance</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> checks.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Using threads when determining DLL dependencies. This
will speed up the un-cached case on Windows by a fair bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Also remove unused assignments for mutable constant values.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Also optimize calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code> built-in, this was so far
not done.</p></li>
<li><p>Statically optimize iteration over constant values that are not
iterable into errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed Fortran, Java, LaTex, PDF, etc. stuff from the inline copies
of Scons for faster startup and leaner code. Also updated to 3.0.1
which is no important difference over 3.0.0 for Nuitka however.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to always release temporary objects before checking for

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id153" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks important progress, as the locals dictionary tracing
is a huge step ahead in terms of correctness and proper optimization.
The actual resulting dictionary is not yet optimized, but that ought to
follow soon now.</p>
<p>The initial support of 3.7 is important. Right now it apparently works
pretty well as a 3.6 replacement already, but definitely a lot more work
will be needed to fully catch up.</p>
<p>For standalone, this accumulated a lot of improvements related to the
plugin side of Nuitka. Thanks to those involved in making this better.
On Windows things ought to be much faster now, due to parallel usage of
dependency walker.</p>

<p>This release continued the distutils integration adding first tests, but

generic, but not yet put to use. If we use this to also trace dictionary
keys, we can expect a lot of improvements for class code again.</p>
<p>The locals dictionary tracing will be the focus before resuming the work
on C types, where the ultimate performance boost lies. However,
currently, not the full compatibility has been achieved even with
currently using dictionaries for classes, and we would like to be able
to statically optimize those better anyway.</p>

<li><p>Windows: When using Scons for Python3 and Scons for Python2 on the

migrate. Make the Scons cache directory use the Python ABI version as
a key too, to avoid these issues. Fixed in 0.5.28.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Fixup for Python3 and Scons no more generating the MinGW64
import library for Python anymore properly. Was only working if
cached from a previous install of Nuitka. Fixed in 0.5.28.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: Made the data files plugin mandatory and added support for
the scrapy package needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, added implicit dependencies for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg_resources.external</span></code>
package. Fixed in 0.5.28.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, an import of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x.y</span></code> where this was not a package didn’t cause
the package <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> to be included.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">six.moves</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requests.packages</span></code>

modules loaded during Python library initialization in a more

<li><p>Fix, unused closure variables could lead to a crash in they were
passed to a nested function.</p></li>

<li><p>Added cache for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">depends.exe</span></code> results. This speeds up standalone
mode again as some of these calls were really slow.</p></li>
<li><p>The import tracer is more robust against recursion and works with

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id173" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release was done to get the fixes and new features out for testing.
There is work started that should make generators use an explicit extra
stack via pointer, and restore instruction state via goto dispatchers at
function entry, but that is not complete.</p>
<p>This feature, dubbed “goto generators” will remove the need for fibers
(which is itself a lot of code), reduce the memory footprint at run time
for anything that uses a lot of generators, or coroutines.</p>
<p>Integrating with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">distutils</span></code> is also a new thing, and once completed
will make use of Nuitka for existing projects automatic and trivial to
do. There is a lot missing for that goal, but we will get there.</p>
<p>Also, documenting how to run tests against compiled code, if that test
code lives inside of that package, will make a huge difference, as that
will make it easier for people to torture Nuitka with their own test
cases.</p>
<p>And then of course, nested frames now mean that every function could be
inlined, which was previously not possible due to collisions of frames.
This will pave the route for better optimization in those cases in
future releases.</p>
<p>The experimental features will require more work, but should make it
easier to use Nuitka for existing projects. Future releases will make
integrating Nuitka dead simple, or that is the hope.</p>
<p>And last but not least, now that Scons works with Python3, chances are
that Nuitka will more often work out the of the box. The older Python3
versions that still retain the issue are not very widespread.</p>

<p>This release comes a lot of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<div class="section" id="id174">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id174" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, need to add recursed modules immediately to the working set, or
else they might first be processed in second pass, where global names
that are locally assigned, are optimized to the built-in names
although that should not happen. Fixed in 0.5.26.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the accelerated call of methods could crash for some special
types. This had been a regress of 0.5.25, but only happens with
custom extension types. Fixed in 0.5.26.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">async</span> <span class="pre">def</span></code> functions parameter variables could fail
to properly work with in-place assignments to them. Fixed in 0.5.26.4
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Decorators that overload type checks didn’t pass the
checks for compiled types. Now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isinstance</span></code> and as a result
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspect</span></code> module work fine for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Fix, imports from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__</span></code> were crashing the
compiler. You are not supposed to do them, because they duplicate the
package code, but they work.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Fix, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">super</span></code> built-in on module level was
crashing the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: For Linux, BSD and macOS extension modules and shared
libraries using their own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$ORIGIN</span></code> to find loaded DLLs resulted in
those not being included in the distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added more missing implicit dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Fix, implicit imports now also can be optional, as e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_tkinter</span></code> if not installed. Only include those if available.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--recompile-c-only</span></code> was only working with C compiler as a
backend, but not in the C++ compatibility fallback, where files get
renamed. This prevented that edit and test debug approach with at
least MSVC.</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins: The PyLint plug-in didn’t consider the symbolic name
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import-error</span></code> but only the code <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">F0401</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Implicit exception raises in conditional expressions would crash the
compiler.</p></li>

<li><p>Added option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python2-for-scons</span></code> to specify the Python2 execute

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id176" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>References to known unassigned variables are now statically optimized
to exception raises and warned about if the according option is
enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Unhashable keys in dictionaries are now statically optimized to
exception raises and warned about if the according option is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable forward propagation for classes too, resulting in some classes
to create only static dictionaries. Currently this never happens for
Python3, but it will, once we can statically optimize <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__prepare__</span></code>
too.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable inlining of class dictionary creations if they are mere return
statements of the created dictionary. Currently this never happens
for Python3, see above for why.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Selecting the metaclass is now visible in the tree and can
be statically optimized.</p></li>
<li><p>For executables, we now also use a freelist for traceback objects,
which also makes exception cases slightly faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Generator expressions no longer require the use of a function call
with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.0</span></code> argument value to carry the iterator value, instead
their creation is directly inlined.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove “pass through” frames for Python2 list contractions, they are
no longer needed. Minimal gain for generated code, but more
lightweight at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>When compiling Windows x64 with MinGW64 a link library needs to be
created for linking against the Python DLL. This one is now cached
and re-used if already done.</p></li>
<li><p>Use common code for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NameError</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnboundLocalError</span></code> exception
code raises. In some cases it was creating the full string at compile
time, in others at run time. Since the later is more efficient in
terms of code size, we now use that everywhere, saving a bit of
binary size.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to release unused functions from a module. This saves
memory and can be decided after a full pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OrderedDict</span></code> in a couple of places, where they are not
needed, but can be replaced with a later sorting, e.g. temporary
variables by name, to achieve deterministic output. This saves memory
at compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Add specialized return nodes for the most frequent constant values,
which are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code>. Also a general one, for
constant value return, which avoids the constant references. This
saves quite a bit of memory and makes traversal of the tree a lot
faster, due to not having any child nodes for the new forms of return
statements.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously the empty dictionary constant reference was specialized to
save memory. Now we also specialize empty set, list, and tuple
constants to the same end. Also the hack to make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is</span></code> not say that
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{}</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">{}</span></code> was made more general, mutable constant references and
now known to never alias.</p></li>
<li><p>The source references can be marked internal, which means that they
should never be visible to the user, but that was tracked as a flag
to each of the many source references attached to each node in the
tree. Making a special class for internal references avoids storing
this in the object, but instead it’s now a class property.</p></li>
<li><p>The nodes for named variable reference, assignment, and deletion got
split into separate nodes, one to be used before the actual variable
can be determined during tree building, and one for use later on.
This makes their API clearer and saves a tiny bit of memory at
compile time.</p></li>
<li><p>Also eliminated target variable references, which were pseudo
children of assignments and deletion nodes for variable names, that
didn’t really do much, but consume processing time and memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for calls to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staticmethod</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">classmethod</span></code>
built-in methods along with type shapes.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open</span></code> built-in on Python3, also adding the
type shape <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">file</span></code> for the result.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytearray</span></code> built-in and constant values.
These mutable constants can now be compile time computed as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozenset</span></code> built-in and constant values.
These mutable constants can now be compile time computed as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">divmod</span></code> built-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Treat all built-in constant types, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type</span></code> itself as a
constant. So far we did this only for constant values types, but of
course this applies to all types, giving slightly more compact code
for their uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Detect static raises if iterating over non-iterables and warn about
them if the option is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Split of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals</span></code> node into different types, one which needs the
updated value, and one which just makes a copy. Properly track if a
functions needs an updated locals dict, and if it doesn’t, don’t use
that. This gives more efficient code for Python2 classes, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> using functions in Python2.</p></li>
<li><p>Build all constant values without use of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pickle</span></code> module which
has a lot more overhead than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">marshal</span></code>, instead use that for too
large <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> values, non-UTF8 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> values, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nan</span></code> float,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Detect the linker arch for all Linux platforms using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">objdump</span></code>
instead of only a hand few hard coded ones.</p></li>

<li><p>Use functions not vulenerable for buffer overflow. This is generally
good and avoids warnings given on OpenBSD during linking.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable closure for classes is different from all functions, don’t
handle the difference in the base class, but for class nodes only.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mayBeNone</span></code> doesn’t return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> which means normally
“unclear”, but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code> instead, since it’s always clear for those
cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparison nodes were using the general comparison node as a base
class, but now a proper base class was added instead, allowing for
cleaner code.</p></li>
<li><p>Valgrind test runners got changed to using proper tool namespace for
their code and share it.</p></li>
<li><p>Made construct case generation code common testing code for re-use in
the speedcenter web site. The code also has minor beauty bugs which
will then become fixable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">appdirs</span></code> package to determine place to store the downloaded
copy of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">depends.exe</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code still mentioned C++ in a lot of places, in comments or
identifiers, which might be confusing readers of the code.</p></li>
<li><p>Code objects now carry all information necessary for their creation,
and no longer need to access their parent to determine flag values.
That parent is subject to change in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Our import sorting wrapper automatically detects imports that could
be local and makes them so, removing a few existing ones and
preventing further ones on the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleanups and annotations to become Python3 PyLint clean as well. This
found e.g. that source code references only had <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__cmp__</span></code> and need
rich comparison to be fully portable.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id180" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release improves many areas. The variable closure taking is now

built-ins were completed.</p>
<p>This release again improves the scalability of Nuitka, which again uses
less memory than before, although not an as big jump as before.</p>
<p>This does not extend or use special C code generation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> or

Added fallback to using full copy in that case.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Fix coroutines to close the “yield from” where an
exception is thrown into them.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Fix, list contractions should have their own frame too.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux: Copy the “rpath” of compiling Python binary to the created
binary. This will make compiled binaries using uninstalled Python
versions transparently find the Python shared library.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Add the “rpath” of the compiling Python binary to the
search path when checking for DLL dependencies on Linux. This fixes
standalone support for Travis and Anaconda on Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>Scons: When calling scons, also try to locate a Python2 binary to
overcome a potential Python3 virtualenv in which Nuitka is running.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Ignore more Windows only encodings on non-Windows.</p></li>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id182" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Support for Python 3.6 with only few corner cases not supported yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Added options <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-arch</span></code> to pick 32 or 64 bits Python target
of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-version</span></code> argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for more kinds of virtualenv configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Uninstalled Python versions such as Anaconda will work fine in

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id183">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id183" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The node tree children are no longer stored in a separate dictionary,
but in the instance dictionary as attributes, making the tree more
lightweight and in principle faster to access. This also saved about
6% of the memory usage.</p></li>
<li><p>The memory usage of Nuitka for the Python part has fallen by roughly
40% due to the use of new style classes, and slots where that is
possible (some classes use multiple inheritance, where they don’t
work), and generally by reducing useless members e.g. in source code
references. This of course also will make things compiled faster (the
C compilation of course is not affected by this.)</p></li>
<li><p>The code generation for frames was creating the dictionary for the
raised exception by making a dictionary and then adding all
variables, each tested to be set. This was a lot of code for each
frame specific, and has been replaced by a generic “attach” mechanism
which merely stores the values, and only takes a reference. When
asked for frame locals, it only then builds the dictionary. So this
is now only done, when that is absolutely necessary, which it
normally never is. This of course makes the C code much less verbose,
and actual handling of exceptions much more efficient.</p></li>
<li><p>For imports, we now detect for built-in modules, that their import
cannot fail, and if name lookups can fail. This leads to less code
generated for error handling of these. The following code now e.g.
fully detects that no <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ImportError</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeError</span></code> will
occur.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added more type shapes for built-in type calls. These will improve
type tracing.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiled frames now have a free list mechanism that should speed up
frames that recurse and frames that exit with exceptions. In case of
an exception, the frame ownership is immediately transferred to the
exception making it easier to deal with.</p></li>
<li><p>The free list implementations have been merged into a new common one
that can be used via macro expansion. It is now type agnostic and be
slightly more efficient too.</p></li>
<li><p>Also optimize “true” division and “floor division”, not only the
default division of Python2.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed the need for statement context during code generation making
it less memory intensive and faster.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="id184">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id184" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Now always uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__</span></code> built-in node for all kinds of
imports and directly optimizes and recursion into other modules based
on that kind of node, instead of a static variant. This removes
duplication and some incompatibility regarding defaults usage when
doing the actual imports at run time.</p></li>
<li><p>Split the expression node bases and mixin classes to a dedicated
module, moving methods that only belong to expressions outside of the
node base, making for a cleaner class hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaned up the class structure of nodes, added base classes for
typical compositions, e.g. expression with and without children,
computation based on built-in, etc. while also checking proper
ordering of base classes in the metaclass.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved directory and file operations to dedicated module, making also
sure it is more generally used. This makes it easier to make more
error resilient deletions of directories on e.g. Windows, where locks
tend to live for short times beyond program ends, requiring second
attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Code generation for existing supported types, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObject</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObject</span> <span class="pre">**</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">struct</span> <span class="pre">Nuitka_CellObject</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> is now done via a
C type class hierarchy instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elif</span></code> sequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Closure taking is now always done immediately correctly and
references are take for closure variables still needed, making sure
the tree is correct and needs no finalization.</p></li>
<li><p>When doing variable traces, initialize more traces immediately so it
can be more reliable.</p></li>
<li><p>Code to setup a function for local variables and clean it up has been
made common code instead of many similar copies.</p></li>
<li><p>The code was treating the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f_executing</span></code> frame member as if it were
a counter with increases and decreases. Turn it into a mere boolean
value and hide its usage behind helper functions.</p></li>
<li><p>The “maybe local variables” are no more. They were replaced by a new
locals dict access node with a fallback to a module or closure
variable should the dictionary not contain the name. This avoids many
ugly checks to not do certain things for that kind of variable.</p></li>
<li><p>We now detect “exec” and “unqualified exec” as well as “star import”
ahead of time as flags of the function to be created. We no longer
need to mark functions as we go.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle “true”, “floor” and normal division properly by applying
future flags to decide which one to use.</p></li>
<li><p>We now use symbolic identifiers in all PyLint annotations.</p></li>
<li><p>The release scripts started to move into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.tools.release</span></code> so
they get PyLint checks, autoformat and proper code re-use.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INCREASE_REFCOUNT_X</span></code> was removed, it got replaced with
proper <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Py_XINCREF</span></code> usages.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INCREASE_REFCOUNT</span></code> got reduced further, e.g. no
generated code uses it anymore, and only a few compiled types do. The
function was once required before “C-ish” lifted the need to do
everything in one single function call.</p></li>

<li><p>Moved tests common code into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.tools.testing</span></code> namespace and

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id187" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks huge progress. The node tree is now absolutely clean,
the variable closure taking is fully represented, and code generation is
prepared to add another type, e.g. for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> for which work has
already started.</p>
<p>On a practical level, the scalability of the release will have increased
very much, as this uses so much less memory, generates simpler C code,
while at the same time getting faster for the exception cases.</p>
<p>Coming releases will expand on the work of this release.</p>
<p>Frame objects should be allowed to be nested inside a function for
better re-formulations of classes and contractions of all kinds, as well
as real inline of functions, even if they could raise.</p>
<p>The memory savings could be even larger, if we stopped doing multiple
inheritance for more node types. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__slots__</span></code> were and the child
API change could potentially make things not only more compact, but
faster to use too.</p>
<p>And also once special C code generation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> is done, it will
set the stage for more types to follow (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code>, etc). Only
this will finally start to give the C type speed we are looking for.</p>
<p>Until then, this release marks a huge cleanup and progress to what we
already had, as well as preparing the big jump in speed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Python3.5: Coroutine methods using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">super</span></code> were crashing the
compiler. Fixed in 0.5.24.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.3: Generator return values were not properly transmitted in
case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></code> values.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Better interoperability between compiled coroutines and
uncompiled generator coroutines.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: Added support to compile in Python debug mode under
Windows too.</p></li>
<li><p>Generators with arguments were using two code objects, one with, and
one without the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CO_NOFREE</span></code> flag, one for the generator object
creating function, and one for the generator object.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3.5: The duplicate code objects for generators with arguments
lead to interoperability issues with between such compiled generator
coroutines and compiled coroutines. Fixed in 0.5.24.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: On some Linux variants, e.g. Debian Stretch and Gentoo,
the linker needs more flags to really compile to a binary with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RPATH</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: For set literal values, insertion order is wrong on
some versions of Python, we now detect the bug and emulate it if
necessary, previous Nuitka was always correct, but incompatible.</p>

<li><p>Windows: Make the batch files detect where they live at run time,
instead of during <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code>, making it possible to use them for
all cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added package paths to DLL scan for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">depends.exe</span></code>, as
with wheels there now sometimes live important DLLs too.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, the clang mode was regressed and didn’t work anymore, breaking
the macOS support entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: For imports, we were passing for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals</span></code> argument a
real dictionary with actual values. That is not what CPython does, so
stopped doing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, for raised exceptions not passing the validity tests, they could
be used after free, causing crashes.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id190" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Faster method calls, combining attribute lookup and method call into
one, where order of evaluation with arguments doesn’t matter. This
gives really huge relative speedups for method calls with no
arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster attribute lookup in general for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object</span></code> descendants, which
is all new style classes, and all built-in types.</p></li>
<li><p>Added dedicated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xrange</span></code> built-in implementation for Python2 and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range</span></code> for Python3. This makes those faster while also solving
ordering problems when creating constants of these types.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code> again, using quick iteration interface and specialized
quick iteration code for typical standard type containers, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiled generators were making sure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StopIteration</span></code> was set after
their iteration, although most users were only going to clear it. Now
only the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> method, which really needs that does it. This speed
up the closing of generators quite a bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiled generators were preparing a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">throw</span></code> into non-started
compilers, to be checked for immediately after their start. This is
now handled in a generic way for all generators, saving code and
execution time in the normal case.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiled generators were applying checks only useful for manual
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">send</span></code> calls even during iteration, slowing them down.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiled generators could duplicate code objects due to handling a
flag for closure variables differently.</p></li>
<li><p>For compiled frames, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f_trace</span></code> is not writable, but was taking
and releasing references to what must be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>, which is not
useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Not passing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals</span></code> to import calls make it less code and faster

<li><p>This release also prepares Python 3.6 support, it includes full
language support on the level of CPython 3.6.0 with the sole
exception of the new generator coroutines.</p></li>
<li><p>The improved mode is now the default, and full compatibility is now
the option, used by test suites. For syntax errors, improved mode is
always used, and for test suites, now only the error message is
compared, but not call stack or caret positioning anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed long deprecated option “–no-optimization”. Code generation
too frequently depends on not seeing unoptimized code. This has been
hidden and broken long enough to finally remove it.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for Python3.5 numbers to Speedcenter. There are now
also tags for speedcenter, indicating how well “develop” branch fares
in comparison to the stable branch.</p></li>
<li><p>With a new tool, source code and Developer Manual contents can be
kept in sync, so that descriptions can be quoted there. Eventually a
full Sphinx documentation might become available, but for now this
makes it workable.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id192" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Moved the tools to compare CPython output, to sort import statements

with PyLint to a common new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.tools</span></code> package, runnable with

<li><p>The tools now share code to find source files, or have it for the
first time, and other things, e.g. finding needed binaries on Windows
installations.</p></li>
<li><p>No longer patch traceback objects dealloc function. Should not be
needed anymore, and most probably was only bug hiding.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved handling of ast nodes related to import handling to the proper
reformulation module.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved statement generation code to helpers module, making it
accessible without cyclic dependencies that require local imports.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed deprecated method for getting constant code objects in favor
of the new way of doing it. Both methods were still used, making it
harder to analyse.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed useless temporary variable initializations from complex call
helper internal functions. They worked around code generation issues
that have long been solved.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id194" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The quick iteration is a precursor to generally faster iteration over
unknown object iterables. Expanding this to general code generation, and
not just the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code> built-in, might yield significant gains for normal
code in the future, once we do code generation based on type inference.</p>
<p>The faster method calls complete work that was already prepared in this
domain and also will be expanded to more types than compiled functions.
More work will be needed to round this up.</p>
<p>Adding support for 3.6.0 in the early stages of its release, made sure
we pretty much have support for it ready right after release. This is
always a huge amount of work, and it’s good to catch up.</p>
<p>This release is again a significant improvement in performance, and is
very important to clean up open ends. Now the focus of coming releases
will now be on both structural optimization, e.g. taking advantage of
the iterator tracing, and specialized code generation, e.g. for those
iterations really necessary to use quick iteration code.</p>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id196" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Python2: Generators were saving and restoring exceptions, updating
the variables <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_type</span></code> for every context switch, making it
really slow, as these are 3 dictionary updates, normally not needed.
Now it’s only doing it if it means a change.</p></li>
<li><p>Sped up creating generators, coroutines and coroutines by attaching
the closure variable storage directly to the object, using one
variable size allocation, instead of two, once of which was a
standard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc</span></code>. This makes creating them easier and avoids
maintaining the closure pointer entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>Using dedicated compiled cell implementation similar to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyCellObject</span></code> but fully under our control. This allowed for
smaller code generated, while still giving a slight performance
improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Added free list implementation to cache generator, coroutines, and
function objects, avoiding the need to create and delete this kind of
objects in a loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code>, making slight optimizations
to be much faster when iterating over lists and tuples, as well as
fast <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> sum for Python2, and much faster <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> sums too.
This is using a prototype version of a “qiter” concept.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id198" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release improves very heavily on generators in Nuitka. The memory
allocator is used more cleverly, and free lists all around save a lot of
interactions with it. More work lies ahead in this field, as these are
not yet as fast as they should be. However, at least Nuitka should be
faster than CPython for these kind of usages now.</p>
<p>Also, proper pure C in the Scons is relatively important to cover more
of the rarer use cases, where the C compiler is too old.</p>
<p>The most important part is actually how <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sum</span></code> optimization is staging
a new kind of approach for code generation. This could become the
standard code for iterators in loops eventually, making <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops
even faster. This will be for future releases to expand.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id204" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks a huge step forward. We are having the structure for
type inference now. This will expand in coming releases to cover more
cases, and there are many low hanging fruits for optimization.
Specialized codes for variable versions of certain known shapes seems
feasible now.</p>
<p>Then there is also the move towards pure C. This will make the backend
compilation lighter, but due to using C11, we will not suffer any loss
of convenience compared to “C-ish”. The plan is to use continue to use
C++ for compilation for compilers not capable of supporting C11.</p>
<p>The amount of static analysis done in Nuitka is now going to quickly
expand, with more and more constructs predicted to raise errors or
simplified. This will be an ongoing activity, as many types of
expressions need to be enhanced, and only one missing will not let it
optimize as well.</p>
<p>Also, it seems about time to add dedicated code for specific types to be
as fast as C code. This opens up vast possibilities for acceleration and
will lead us to zero overhead C bindings eventually. But initially the
drive is towards enhanced <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span></code> analysis, to become able to know
the precide module expected to be imported, and derive type information
from this.</p>
<p>The coming work will attack to start whole program optimization, as well
as enhanced local value shape analysis, as well specialized type code
generation, which will make Nuitka improve speed.</p>

miss out on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staticmethod</span></code> decorator that is implicit. It’s now
applied always, unless of course it’s already done manually. This
corrects an issue found with Pandas. Fixed in 0.5.22.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: For at least Python 3.4 or higher, it could happen that
the locale needed was not importable. Fixed in 0.5.22.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Do not falsely assume that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span></code> expressions cannot
raise on boolean expressions, since those arguments might raise
during creation. This could lead to wrong optimization. Fixed in
0.5.22.2 already.</p></li>

distribution created. This would lead to problems for some
configurations on Linux in cases the glibc is no longer compatible
with newer or older kernels. Fixed in 0.5.22.2 already.</p></li>

of the traces attached to it. For non-shared variables, this allows
to sooner tell attributes of those variables, allowing for sooner
optimization of them.</p></li>
<li><p>No longer trace all initial users of a variable, just merely if there
were such and if it constitutes sharing syntactically too. Not only
does this save memory, it avoids useless references of the variable
to functions that stop using it due to optimization.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id222" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release aimed at dictionary tracing. As a first step, the value
assign is now traced to have a dictionary shape, and this this then used
to lower the operations which used to be normal subscript operations to
mapping, but now can be more specific.</p>
<p>Making use of the dictionary values knowledge, tracing keys and values
is not yet inside the scope, but expected to follow. We got the first
signs of type inference here, but to really take advantage, more
specific shape tracing will be needed.</p>

<li><p>The SSA analysis is now enabled by default, eliminating variables
that are not shared, and can be forward propagated. This is currently
limited mostly to compile time constants, but things won’t remain
that way.</p></li>
<li><p>Code generation for many constructs now takes into account if a
specific operation can raise or not. If e.g. an attribute look-up is
known to not raise, then that is now decided by the node the looked
is done to, and then more often can determine this, or even directly
the value.</p></li>
<li><p>Calls to C-API that we know cannot raise, no longer check, but merely

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id246" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The release includes many important new directions. Coverage analysis
will be important to remain certain of test coverage of Nuitka itself.
This is mostly done, but needs more work to complete.</p>
<p>Then the graphing surely will help us to debug and understand code
examples. So instead of tracing, and reading stuff, we should visualize
things, to more clearly see, how things evolve under optimization
iteration, and where exactly one thing goes wrong. This will be improved
as it proves necessary to do just that. So far, this has been rare.
Expect this to become end user capable with time. If only to allow you
to understand why Nuitka won’t optimize code of yours, and what change
of Nuitka it will need to improve.</p>
<p>The comparative performance benchmarking is clearly the most important
thing to have for users. It deserves to be the top priority. Thanks to
the PyPy tool <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vmprof</span></code>, we may already be there on the data taking
side, but the presenting and correlation part, is still open and a fair
bit of work. It will be most important to empower users to make
competent performance bug reports, now that Nuitka enters the phase,
where these things matter.</p>
<p>As this is a lot of ground to cover. More than ever. We can make this
compiler, but only if you help, it will arrive in your life time.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.5.14<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-5-14" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release is an intermediate step towards value propagation, which is
not considered ready for stable release yet. The major point is the
elimination of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> expressions, as they are problems
to SSA. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> statement change is delayed.</p>

<div class="section" id="id249">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id249" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Function in-lining is now present in the code, but still disabled,
because it needs more changes in other areas, before we can generally
do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Trivial outlines, result of re-formulations or function in-lining,
are now in-lined, in case they just return an expression.</p></li>
<li><p>The re-formulation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> has been giving up,
eliminating the use of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> expression, at the cost
of dedicated boolean nodes and code generation for these.</p>
<p>This saves around 8% of compile time memory for Nuitka, and allows
for faster and more complete optimization, and gets rid of a
complicated structure for analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a frame is used in an exception, its locals are detached. This
was done more often than necessary and even for frames that are not
necessary our own ones. This will speed up some exception cases.</p></li>
<li><p>When the default arguments, or the keyword default arguments
(Python3) or the annotations (Python3) were raising an exception, the
function definition is now replaced with the exception, saving a code
generation. This happens frequently with Python2/Python3 compatible
code guarded by version checks.</p></li>
<li><p>The SSA analysis for loops now properly traces “break” statement
situations and merges the post-loop situation from all of them. This
significantly allows for and improves optimization of code following
the loop.</p></li>
<li><p>The SSA analysis of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> statements has been greatly
enhanced. The handler for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> is now optimized for exception
raise and no exception raise individually, as well as for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> in the tried code. The SSA analysis for
after the statement is now the result of merging these different
cases, should they not abort.</p></li>
<li><p>The code generation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">del</span></code> statements is now taking advantage
should there be definite knowledge of previous value. This speed them
up slightly.</p></li>
<li><p>The SSA analysis of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">del</span></code> statements now properly decided if the
statement can raise or not, allowing for more optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>For list contractions, the re-formulation was enhanced using the new
outline construct instead of a pseudo function, leading to better
analysis and code generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparison chains are now re-formulated into outlines too, allowing
for better analysis of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions raised in function creations, e.g. in default values, are
now propagated, eliminating the function’s code. This happens most
often with Python2/Python3 in branches. On the other hand, function
creations that cannot are also annotated now.</p></li>
<li><p>Closure variables that become unreferenced outside of the function
become normal variables leading to better tracing and code generation
for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Function creations cannot raise except their defaults, keyword
defaults or annotations do.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in references can now be converted to strings at compile time,
e.g. when printed.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id251" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Moved more parts of code generation to their own modules, and used
registry for code generation for more expression kinds.</p></li>
<li><p>Unified <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">except</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> into a single
construct that handles both through
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">except</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> semantics.
Finally is now solved via duplicating the handler into cases
necessary.</p>
<p>No longer are nodes annotated with information if they need to
publish the exception or not, this is now all done with the dedicated
nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> expressions have been replaced with outline
function bodies, that instead of side effect statements, are more
like functions with return values, allowing for easier analysis and
dedicated code generation of much lower complexity.</p></li>
<li><p>No more “tolerant” flag for release nodes, we now decide this fully
based on SSA information.</p></li>
<li><p>Added helper for assertions that code flow does not reach certain
positions, e.g. a function must return or raise, aborting statements
do not continue and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>To keep cloning of code parts as simple as possible, the limited use
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeCloneAt</span></code> has been changed to a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">makeClone</span></code> which
produces identical copies, which is what we always do. And a generic
cloning based on “details” has been added, requiring to make
constructor arguments and details complete and consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>The re-formulation code helpers have been improved to be more
convenient at creating nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>The old <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.codegen</span></code> module <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Generator</span></code> was still used for
many things. These now all got moved to appropriate code generation
modules, and their users got updated, also moving some code generator
functions in the process.</p></li>
<li><p>The module <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.codegen.CodeTemplates</span></code> got replaces with direct
uses of the proper topic module from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.codegen.templates</span></code>,
with some more added, and their names harmonized to be more easily
recognizable.</p></li>
<li><p>Added more assertions to the generated code, to aid bug finding.</p></li>
<li><p>The autoformat now sorts pylint markups for increased consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Releases no longer have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tolerant</span></code> flag, this was not needed
anymore as we use SSA.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle CTRL-C in scons code preventing per job messages that are not
helpful and avoid tracebacks from scons, also remove more unused
tools like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rpm</span></code> from out in-line copy.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id252">
<h3>Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id252" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added the CPython3.4 test suite.</p></li>
<li><p>The CPython3.2, CPython3.3, and CPython3.4 test suite now run with
Python2 giving the same errors. Previously there were a few specific
errors, some with line numbers, some with different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code>
be raised, due to different order of checks.</p>
<p>This increases the coverage of the exception raising tests somewhat.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also the CPython3.x test suites now all pass with debug Python, as
does the CPython 2.6 test suite with 2.6 now.</p></li>
<li><p>Added tests to cover all forms of unpacking assignments supported in
Python3, to be sure there are no other errors unknown to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Started to document the reference count tests, and to make it more
robust against SSA optimization. This will take some time and is work
in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Made the compile library test robust against modules that raise a
syntax error, checking that Nuitka does the same.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id253" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is clearly major. It represents a huge step forward for
Nuitka as it improves nearly every aspect of code generation and
analysis. Removing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> expression nodes proved to be
necessary in order to even have the correct SSA in their cases. Very
important optimization was blocked by it.</p>
<p>Going forward, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> statements will be removed and
dead variable elimination will happen, which then will give function
inlining. This is expected to happen in one of the next releases.</p>
<p>This release is a consolidation of 8 hotfix releases, and many
refactorings needed towards the next big step, which might also break
things, and for that reason is going to get its own release cycle.</p>

<div class="section" id="id254">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id254" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix, relative imports in packages were not working with absolute
imports enabled via future flags. Fixed in 0.5.12.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Loops were not properly degrading knowledge from inside the loop at
loop exit, and therefore this could have lead missing checks and
releases in code generation for cases, for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">del</span></code> statements in the
loop body. Fixed in 0.5.12.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> re-formulation could trigger false assertions,
due to early releases for compatibility. Fixed in 0.5.12.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, optimizion of calls of constant objects (always an exception),
crashed the compiler.Fixed in 0.5.12.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site.py</span></code> installations with a
leading <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">def</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">class</span></code> statement, which is defeating our
attempt to patch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__file__</span></code> for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: In full compatibility mode, the tracebacks of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> expressions are now as wrong as they are in CPython. Does
not apply to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--improved</span></code> mode.</p></li>

for PyQt5.</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Improved parsing of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">otool</span></code> output to avoid duplicate
entries, which can also be entirely wrong in the case of Qt plugins
at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid relative paths for main program with file reference mode
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">original</span></code>, as it otherwise changes as the file moves.</p></li>
<li><p>MinGW: The created modules depended on MinGW to be in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PATH</span></code> for
their usage. This is no longer necessary, as we now link these
libraries statically for modules too.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: For modules, the option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--run</span></code> to immediately load the
modules had been broken for a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Ignore Windows DLLs that were attempted to be loaded, but
then failed to load. This happens e.g. when both PySide and PyQt are
installed, and could cause the dreaded conflicting DLLs message. The
DLL loaded in error is now ignored, which avoids this.</p></li>
<li><p>MinGW: The resource file used might be empty, in which case it
doesn’t get created, avoiding an error due to that.</p></li>
<li><p>MinGW: Modules can now be created again. The run time relative code
uses an API that is WinXP only, and MinGW failed to find it without

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id260" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is major due to amount of ground covered. The reduction in
memory usage of Nuitka itself (the C++ compiler will still use much
memory) is very massive and an important aspect of scalability too.</p>
<p>Then the SSA changes are truly the first sign of major improvements to
come. In their current form, without eliminating dead assignments, the
full advantage is not taken yet, but the next releases will do this, and
that’s a major milestone to Nuitka.</p>
<p>The other optimization mostly stem from looking at things closer, and
trying to work towards function in-lining, for which we are making a lot
of progress now.</p>

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> was not yet initialized properly, if this was a global
constant, i.e. used in multiple modules. Fixed in 0.5.11.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Recent fixes around <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__path__</span></code> revealed issues with
PyWin32, where modules from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win32com.shell</span></code> were not properly
recursed to. Fixed in 0.5.11.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>The importing of modules with the same name as a built-in module
inside a package falsely assumed these were the built-ins which need
not exist, and then didn’t recurse into them. This affected
standalone mode the most, as the module was then missing entirely.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id272" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release brings exciting new optimization with the focus on the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code> constructs, now being done more optimal. It is also a
maintenance release, bringing out compatibility improvements, and
important bug fixes, and important usability features for the deployment
of modules and packages, that further expand the use cases of Nuitka.</p>
<p>The git flow had to be applied this time to get out fixes for regression
bug fixes, that the big change of the last release brought, so this is
also to consolidate these and the other corrections into a full release
before making more invasive changes.</p>
<p>The cleanups are leading the way to expanded SSA applied to global
variable and shared variable values as well. Already the built-in detect
is now based on global SSA information, which was an important step
ahead.</p>

<div class="section" id="cleanup">
<h3>Cleanup<a class="headerlink" href="#cleanup" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The use of C++ classes for variable objects was removed. Closure
variables are now attached as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyCellObject</span></code> to the function
objects owning them.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of C++ context classes for closure taking and generator
parameters has been replaced with attaching values directly to
functions and generator objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The indentation of code template instantiations spanning multiple was
not in all cases proper. We were using emission objects that handle
it new lines in code and mere <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> objects, that don’t handle
them in mixed forms. Now only the emission objects are used.</p></li>
<li><p>Some templates with C++ helper functions that had no variables got
changed to be properly formatted templates.</p></li>
<li><p>The internal API for handling of exceptions is now more consistent
and used more efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p>The printing helpers got cleaned up and moved to static code,
removing any need for forward declaration.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INCREASE_REFCOUNT_X</span></code> was removed, it got replaced with
proper <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Py_XINCREF</span></code> usages. The function was once required before
“C-ish” lifted the need to do everything in one function call.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">INCREASE_REFCOUNT</span></code> got reduced. See above for why that
is any good. The idea is that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Py_INCREF</span></code> must be good enough, and
that we want to avoid the C function it was, even if in-lined.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assertObject</span></code> function that checks if an object is not
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NULL</span></code> and has positive reference count, i.e. is sane, got turned
into a preprocessor macro.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep hashes of constant values created in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--debug</span></code> mode, which
cover also mutable values, and attempt to depend on actual content.
These are checked at program exit for corruption. This may help
uncover bugs.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id277" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This is the next evolution of “C-ish” coming to pass. The use of C++ has
for all practical purposes vanished. It will remain an ongoing activity
to clear that up and become real C. The C++ classes were a huge road
block to many things, that now will become simpler. One example of these
were in-place operations, which now can be dealt with easily.</p>
<p>Also, lots of polishing and tweaking was done while adding construct
benchmarks that were made to check the impact of these changes. Here,
generators probably stand out the most, as some of the missed
optimization got revealed and then addressed.</p>
<p>Their speed increases will be visible to some programs that depend a lot
on generators.</p>
<p>This release is clearly major in that the most important issues got
addressed, future releases will provide more tuning and completeness,
but structurally the “C-ish” migration has succeeded, and now we can
reap the benefits in the coming releases. More work will be needed for
all in-place operations to be accelerated.</p>
<p>More work will be needed to complete this, but it’s good that this is
coming to an end, so we can focus on SSA based optimization for the
major gains to be had.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id283" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks progress towards having coverage testing. Recent
releases had made it clear that not all code of Nuitka is actually used
at least once in our release tests. We aim at identifying these.</p>
<p>Another direction was to catch cases, where Nuitka leaks exceptions or
is subject to leaked exceptions, which revealed previously unnoticed
errors.</p>
<p>Important changes have been delayed, e.g. the closure variables will not
yet use C++ objects to share storage, but proper <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyCellObject</span></code> for
improved compatibility, and to approach a more “C-ish” status. These is
unfinished code that does this. And the forward propagation of values is
not enabled yet again either.</p>

accumulated out. Expect more actual changes in the next releases.</p>

crashing the compilation. This was a regression, fixed in 0.5.7.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: The name mangling inside classes also needs to be
applied to global variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, proving <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang++</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CXX</span></code> was mistakingly thinking of it

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id289" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release brings about two major changes, each with the risk to break
things.</p>
<p>One is that we finally started to have our own import logic, which has
the risk to cause breakage, but apparently currently rather improved
compatibility. The case issues were not fixable with standard library
code.</p>
<p>The second one is that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__file__</span></code> attributes for standalone mode
is now no longer pointing to the original install and therefore will
expose missing stuff sooner. This will have to be followed up with code
to scan for missing “data” files later on.</p>
<p>For SSA based optimization, there are cleanups in here, esp. the one
removing the name mangling, allowing to remove special code for class
variables. This makes the SSA tree more reliable. Hope is that the big
step (forward propagation through variables) can be made in one of the
next releases.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id300" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The release is mainly the result of consolidation work. While the
previous release contained many important enhancements, this is another
important step towards full SSA, closing one loop whole (class variables
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> functions), as well as applying it to local variables,
largely extending its use.</p>
<p>The amount of cleanups is tremendous, in huge part due to infrastructure
problems that prevented release repeatedly. This reduces the
technological debt very much.</p>
<p>More importantly, it would appear that now eliminating local and
temporary variables that are not necessary is only a small step away.
But as usual, while this may be easy to implement now, it will uncover
more bugs in existing code, that we need to address before we continue.</p>

<li><p>The standalone freezing code was reading Python source as UTF-8 and
not using the code that handles the Python encoding properly. On some
platforms there are files in standard library that are not encoded
like that.</p></li>
<li><p>The fiber implementation for Linux amd64 was not working with glibc
from RHEL 5. Fixed to use now multiple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> to pass pointers as
necessary. Also use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uintptr_t</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">intprt_t</span></code> to
transport pointers, which may be more optimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Line numbers for exceptions were corrupted by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span></code> statements due

<li><p>Partial support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win32com</span></code> by adding support for its hidden
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__path__</span></code> change.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Finally figured out proper chaining of exceptions, given
proper context messages for exception raised during the handling of
exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Corrected C++ memory leak for each closure variable taken, each time
a function object was created.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Raising exceptions with tracebacks already attached, wasn’t
using always them, but producing new ones instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Some constants could cause errors, as they cannot be handled with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">marshal</span></code> module as expected, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(int,)</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Make sure to propagate <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.path</span></code> to the Python
instance used to check for standard library import dependencies. This
is important for virtualenv environments, which need <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site.py</span></code> to
set the path, which is not executed in that mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Added support for different path layout there, so using
virtualenv should work there too.</p></li>
<li><p>The code object flag “optimized” (fast locals as opposed to locals
dictionary) for functions was set wrongly to value for the parent,
but for frames inside it, one with the correct value. This lead to
more code objects than necessary and false <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">co_flags</span></code> values

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id318" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release brings about structural simplification that is both a
follow-up to C-ish, as well as results from a failed attempt to remove
static “variable references” and be fully SSA based. It incorporates
changes aimed at making this next step in Nuitka evolution smaller.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.5.2<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-5-2" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is a major release, with huge changes to code generation that
improve performance in a significant way. It is a the result of a long
development period, and therefore contains a huge jump ahead.</p>
<div class="section" id="id319">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id319" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added experimental support for Python 3.4, which is still work in
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for virtualenv on macOS.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for virtualenv on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for macOS X standalone mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The code generation uses no header files anymore, therefore adding a
module doesn’t invalidate all compiled object files from caches
anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Constants code creation is now distributed, and constants referenced
in a module are declared locally. This means that changing a module
doesn’t affect the validity of other modules object files from caches
anymore.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id320" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>C-ish code generation uses less C++ classes and generates more C-like
code. Explicit temporary objects are now used for statement temporary
variables.</p></li>
<li><p>The constants creation code is no more in a single file, but
distributed across all modules, with only shared values created in a
single file. This means improved scalability. There are remaining bad
modules, but more often, standalone mode is now fast.</p></li>
<li><p>Exception handling no longer uses C++ exception, therefore has become
much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Loops that only break are eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Dead code after loops that do not break is now removed.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">except</span></code> constructs are now
eliminated, where that is possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> part of the re-formulation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code>
statements is now only done when printing to a file, avoiding useless
node tree bloat.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuples and lists are now generated with faster code.</p></li>
<li><p>Locals and global variables are now access with more direct code.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the anonymous <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">code</span></code> type built-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compile</span></code> built-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Generators that statically return immediately, e.g. due to
optimization results, are no longer using frame objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The complex call helpers use no pseudo frames anymore. Previous code
generation required to have them, but with C-ish code generation that
is no more necessary, speeding up those kind of calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules with only code that cannot raise, need not have a frame
created for them. This avoids useless code size bloat because of
them. Previously the frame stack entry was mandatory.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Windows: The resource files were cached by Scons and re-used, even if
the input changed. The could lead to corrupted incremental builds.
Fixed in 0.5.1.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: For functions with too many local variables, the MSVC failed
with an error “C1026: parser stack overflow, program too complex”.
The rewritten code generation doesn’t burden the compiler as much.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: The timing deletion of nested call arguments was

<li><p>Standalone: For virtualenv, the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">orig-prefix.txt</span></code> needs to be
present, now it’s copied into the “dist” directory as well. Fixed in
0.5.1.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Handle cases, where Python and user program are installed on
different volumes.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Can now finally use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execfile</span></code> as an expression. One
of our oldest issues, no 5, is finally fixed after all this time
thanks to C-ish code generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: The order or call arguments deletion is now finally
compatible. This too is thanks to C-ish code generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Code object flags are now more compatible for Python3.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone: Removing “rpath” settings of shared libraries and
extension modules included. This makes standalone binaries more
robust on Fedora 20.</p></li>
<li><p>Python2: Wasn’t falsely rejecting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> strings as values for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> variants with base argument provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: For Python3.2 and 64 bits, global variable accesses could
give false <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NameError</span></code> exceptions. Fixed in 0.5.1.6 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility: Many <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eval</span></code> details have become more
correctly, the argument handling is more compatible, and e.g. future

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id325" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release would deserve more than a minor number increase. The C-ish
code generation, is a huge body of work. In many ways, it lays ground to
taking benefit of SSA results, that previously would not have been
possible. In other ways, it’s incomplete in not yet taking full
advantage yet.</p>
<p>The release contains so many improvements, that are not yet fully
realized, but as a compiler, it also reflects a stable and improved
state.</p>
<p>The important changes are about making SSA even more viable. Many of the
problematic cases, e.g. exception handlers, have been stream lined. A
whole class of variables, temporary keepers, has been eliminated. This
is big news in this domain.</p>
<p>For the standalone users, there are lots of refinements. There is esp. a
lot of work to create code that doesn’t show scalability issues. While
some remain, the most important problems have been dealt with. Others
are still in the pipeline.</p>
<p>More work will be needed to take full advantage. This has been explained
in a <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/posts/state-of-nuitka.html">separate post</a>
in greater detail.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id330" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is mostly an interim maintenance release for standalone.
Major changes that provide optimization beyond that, termed “C-ish code

<p>This release makes standalone practical which is an important point.
Instead of hour long compilation, even for small programs, we are down
to less than a minute.</p>
<p>The solution of the scalability issues with many constants from many
modules will be top priority going forward. Since they are about how
even single use constants are created all in one place, this will be
easy, but as large changes are happening in “C-ish code generation”, we
are waiting for these to complete.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.5.0<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-5-0" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release breaks interface compatibility, therefore the major version

on both Windows, and Linux. Should work much better now.</p>
<p>But consider that this part of Nuitka is still in its infancy. As it is
not the top priority of mine for Nuitka, which primarily is intended as
an super compatible accelerator of Python, it will continue to evolve
nearby.</p>

<li><p>The “standalone mode” was not including all useful encodings. Fixed
in 0.4.7.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>The “standalone mode” was defaulting to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=-S</span></code> which

<p>The “executable by default” interface change improves on the already

terms of numbers, but are all signs of structural improvements, and it
is steadily approaching the point, where the really interesting stuff
will happen.</p>
<p>The progress for standalone mode is of course significant. It is still
not quite there yet, but it is making quick progress now. This will
attract a lot of attention hopefully.</p>
<p>As for optimization, the focus for it has shifted to making exception
handlers work optimal by default (publish the exception to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_info()</span></code> and create traceback only when necessary) and be
based on standard branches. Removing special handling of exception
handlers, will be the next big step. This release includes some
correctness fixes stemming from that work already.</p>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id338" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The “standalone” mode allows to compile standalone binaries for
programs and run them without Python installation. The DLLs loaded by
extension modules on Windows need to be added manually, on Linux
these are determined automatically already.</p>
<p>To achieve running without Python installation, Nuitka learned to
freeze bytecode as an alternative to compiling modules, as some
modules need to be present when the CPython library is initialized.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag</span></code> allows to specify flags to the compiler
that the “python” binary normally would. So far <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-S</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-v</span></code> are
supported, with sane aliases <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no_site</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trace_imports</span></code>.</p>
<p>The recommended use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-flag=-S</span></code> is to avoid dependency
creep in standalone mode compilations, because the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site</span></code> module

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id343" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks major technological progress with the introduction of
the much sought standalone mode and performance improvements from
improved code generation.</p>
<p>The major break through for SSA optimization was not yet achieved, but
this is again making progress in the direction of it. Harmonizing
variables of different kinds was an important step ahead.</p>
<p>Also very nice is the packaging progress, Nuitka was accepted into Arch
after being in Debian Testing for a while already. Hope is to see more
of this kind of integration in the future.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.4.6<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-4-6" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release includes progress on all fronts. The primary focus was to
advance SSA optimization over older optimization code that was already
in place. In this domain, there are mostly cleanups.</p>
<p>Another focus has been to enhance Scons with MSVC on Windows. Nuitka now
finds an installed MSVC compiler automatically, properly handles
architecture of Python and Windows. This improves usability a lot.</p>
<p>Then this is also very much about bug fixes. There have been several hot
fixes for the last release, but a complicated and major issue forced a
new release, and many other small issues.</p>
<p>And then there is performance. As can be seen in the <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/pages/performance.html">performance graph</a>, this release is the
fastest so far. This came mainly from examining the need for comparison
slots for compiled types.</p>
<p>And last, but not least, this also expands the base of supported
platforms, adding Gentoo, and self compiled Python to the mix.</p>

<p>While the SSA stuff is not yet bearing performance fruits, it starts to
carry weight. Taking over the temporary variable handling now also means
we can apply the same stuff to local variables later.</p>

is more traditional code acceleration for rich comparisons, making it
significant, and the bug fixes make Nuitka more compatible than ever.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id354" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is mostly the result of improvements made based on the
surge of users after Europython 2013. Some people went to extents and
reported their experience very detailed, and so I could aim at making
e.g. their misconceptions about how recursion options work, more obvious
through warnings and errors.</p>
<p>This release is not addressing performance improvements. The next
release will be able to focus on that. I am taking my claim of full
compatibility very serious, so any time it’s broken, it’s the highest
priority to restore it.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.4.4<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-4-4" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release marks the point, where Nuitka for the first time supports
all major current Python versions and all major features. It adds Python
3.3 support and it adds support for threading. And then there is a
massive amount of fixes that improve compatibility even further.</p>
<p>Aside of that, there is major performance work. One side is the
optimization of call performance (to CPython non-compiled functions) and
to compiled functions, both. This gave a serious improvement to
performance.</p>
<p>Then of course, we are making other, long term performance progress, as
in “–experimental” mode, the SSA code starts to optimize unused code
away. That code is not yet ready for prime time yet, but the trace
structure will hold.</p>

<li><p>Tracing user provided constants, now Nuitka warns about too large
constants produced during optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Line numbers of expressions are now updates as evaluation progresses.
This almost corrects.</p>
<p>Now only expression parts that cannot raise, do not update, which can
still cause difference, but much less often, and then definitely
useless.</p>

<li><p>Experimental support for threads.</p>
<p>Threading appears to work just fine in the most cases. It’s not as
optimal as I wanted it to be, but that’s going to change with time.</p>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id356" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Previous corrections for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">==</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!=</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;=</span></code>, caused a
performance regression for these operations in case of handling
identical objects.</p>
<p>For built-in objects of sane types (not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code>), these operations
are now accelerated again. The overreaching acceleration of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span></code>
was still there (bug, see below) and has been adapted too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calling non-compiled Python functions from compiled functions was
slower than in CPython. It is now just as fast.</p></li>
<li><p>Calling compiled functions without keyword arguments has been
accelerated with a dedicated entry point that may call the
implementation directly and avoid parameter parsing almost entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>Making calls to compiled and non-compiled Python functions no longer
requires to build a temporary tuple and therefore is much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Parameter parsing code is now more compact, and re-uses error raises,
or creates them on the fly, instead of hard coding it. Saves binary
size and should be more cache friendly.</p></li>

<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id357" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Corrected false optimization of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code> on C++ level.</p>
<p>When it’s not done during Nuitka compile time optimization, the rich
comparison helper still contained short cuts for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span></code>. This is now
the same for all the comparison operators.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Calling a function with default values, not providing it, and not
providing a value for a value without default, was not properly
detecting the error, and instead causing a run time crash.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">):</span>

</div>
<p>This now properly raises the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></code> exception.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constants created with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> could become larger than the normally
enforced limits. Not as likely to become huge, but still potentially
an issue.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vars</span></code> built-in, when used on something without <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__dict__</span></code>
attribute, was giving <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AttributeError</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When re-cursing to modules at compile time, script directory and
current directory were used last, while at run time, it was the other
way around, which caused overloaded standard library modules to not
be embedded.</p>
<p>Thanks for the patch to James Michael DuPont.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Super without arguments was not raising the correct <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RuntimeError</span></code>
exception in functions that cannot be methods, but
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnboundLocalError</span></code> instead.</p>

<li><p>Generators no longer use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">raise</span> <span class="pre">StopIteration</span></code> for return

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> should be honored.</p></li>
<li><p>Exception error message when throwing non-exceptions into generators
was not compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> with value in generators is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code>
before Python3.3, but that was not raised.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable names of the “__var” style need to be mangled. This was only
done for classes, but not for functions contained in classes, there
they are now mangled too.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id358" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>For containers (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>) defined on
the source code level, Nuitka immediately created constant references
from them.</p>
<p>For function calls, class creations, slice objects, this code is now
re-used, and its dictionaries and tuples, may now become constants
immediately, reducing noise in optimization steps.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The parameter parsing code got cleaned up. There were a lot of relics
from previously explored paths. And error raises were part of the
templates, but now are external code.</p></li>
<li><p>Global variable management moved to module objects and out of
“Variables” module.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure, nodes in the tree are not shared by accident.</p>
<p>This helped to find a case of duplicate use in the complex call
helpers functions. Code generation will now notice this kind of
duplication in debug mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The complex call helper functions were manually taking variable
closure, which made these functions inconsistent to other functions,
e.g. no variable version was allocated to assignments.</p>
<p>Removing the manual setting of variables allowed a huge reduction of
code volume, as it became more generic code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Converting user provided constants to create containers into
constants immediately, to avoid noise from doing this in
optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site</span></code> module is now imported explicitly in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__main__</span></code>
module, so it can be handled by the recursion code as well. This will
help portable mode.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id361" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release is in preparation for Europython 2013. Wanted to get this
much out, as it changes the status slides quite a bit, and all of that
was mostly done in my Cyprus holiday a while ago.</p>
<p>The portable code has not seen progress. The idea here is to get this

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.4.3<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-4-3" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release expands the reach of Nuitka substantially, as new platforms
and compilers are now supported. A lot of polish has been applied. Under
the hood there is the continued and in-progress effort to implement SSA
form in Nuitka.</p>
<div class="section" id="id362">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id362" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Support for new compiler: Microsoft Visual C++.</p>
<p>You can now use Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 for
compiling under Windows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for NetBSD.</p>
<p>Nuitka works for at least NetBSD 6.0, older versions may or may not
work. This required fixing bugs in the generic “fibers”
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for Python3 under Windows too.</p>
<p>Nuitka uses Scons to build the generated C++ files. Unfortunately it
requires Python2 to execute, which is not readily available to call
from Python3. It now guesses the default installation paths of
CPython 2.7 or CPython 2.6 and it will use it for running Scons
instead. You have to install it to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C:\Python26</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C:\Python27</span></code>
for Nuitka to be able to find it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enhanced Python 3.3 compatibility.</p>
<p>The support the newest version of Python has been extended, improving
compatibility for many minor corner cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added warning when a user compiles a module and executes it
immediately when that references <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code>.</p>
<p>Because very likely the intention was to create an executable. And
esp. if there is code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In module mode, Nuitka will optimize it away, and nothing will happen
on execution. This is because the command</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nuitka --execute module
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>is behavioral more like</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python -c <span class="s2">&quot;import module&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and that was a trap for new users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All Linux architectures are now supported. Due to changes in how
evaluation order is enforced, we don’t have to implement for specific
architectures anymore.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id363">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id363" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Dictionary creation was not fully compatible.</p>
<p>As revealed by using Nuitka with CPython3.3, the order in which
dictionaries are to be populated needs to be reversed, i.e. CPython
adds the last item first. We didn’t observe this before, and it’s
likely the new dictionary implementation that finds it.</p>
<p>Given that hash randomization makes dictionaries item order
undetermined anyway, this is more an issue of testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluation order for arguments of calls was not effectively enforced.
It is now done in a standards compliant and therefore fully portable
way. The compilers and platforms so far supported were not affected,
but the newly supported Visual Studio C++ compiler was.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__future__</span></code> import inside a function was giving an
assertion, instead of the proper syntax error.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Do not set the attributes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_type</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_value</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_traceback</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Python3: Annotations of function worked only as long as their
definition was not referring to local variables.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id364" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Calls with no positional arguments are now using the faster call
methods.</p>
<p>The generated C++ code was using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">()</span></code> constant at call site,
when doing calls that use no positional arguments, which is of course
useless.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For Windows now uses OS “Fibers” for Nuitka “Fibers”.</p>

MSVC had less issues too.</p>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="id370">
<h3>Bug Fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id370" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Nuitka already supported compilation of “main directories”, i.e.
directories with a “__main__.py” file inside. The resulting binary
name was “__main__.exe” though, but now it is “directory.exe”</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># ls directory</span>
__main__.py

<span class="c1"># nuitka --exe directory</span>
<span class="c1"># ls</span>
directory directory.exe
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This makes this usage more obvious, and fixes an older issue for this
feature.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluation order of binary operators was not enforced.</p>
<p>Nuitka already enforces evaluation order for just about everything.
But not for binary operators it seems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Providing an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">coding:</span> <span class="pre">no-exist</span></code> was crashing under Python2, and
ignored under Python3, now it does the compatible thing for both.</p></li>
<li><p>Global statements on the compiler level are legal in Python, and were
not handled by Nuitka, they now are.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">a</span>  <span class="c1"># Not in a function, but on module level. Pointless but legal!</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Effectively these statements can be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Future imports are only legal when they are at the start of the file.</p>
<p>This was not enforced by Nuitka, making it accept code, which CPython
would reject. It now properly raises a syntax error.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Raising exceptions from context was leaking references.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Under CPython3.2 the above is not allowed (it is acceptable starting
CPython3.3), and was also leaking references to its arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Importing the module that became <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__main__</span></code> through the module
name, didn’t recurse to it.</p>
<p>This also gives a warning. PyBench does it, and then stumbles over
the non-found “pybench” module. Of course, programmers should use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.modules[</span> <span class="pre">&quot;__main__&quot;</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code> to access main module code. Not only
because the duplicated modules don’t share data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compiled method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">repr</span></code> leaked references when printed.</p>
<p>When printing them, they would not be freed, and subsequently hold
references to the object (and class) they belong to. This could
trigger bugs for code that expects <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__del__</span></code> to run at some point.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">super</span></code> built-in leaked references to given object.</p>
<p>This was added, because Python3 needs it. It supplies the arguments
to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">super</span></code> automatically, whereas for Python2 the programmer had to
do it. And now it turns out that the object lost a reference, causing
similar issues as above, preventing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__del__</span></code> to run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">raise</span></code> statement didn’t enforce type of third argument.</p>
<p>This Python2-only form of exception raising now checks the type of
the third argument before using it. Plus, when it’s None (which is
also legal), no reference to None is leaked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Python3 built-in exceptions were strings instead of exceptions.</p>
<p>A gross mistake that went uncaught by test suites. I wonder how. Them
being strings doesn’t help their usage of course, fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-nan</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nan</span></code> both exist and make a difference.</p>
<p>A older story continued. There is a sign to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nan</span></code>, which can be
copied away and should be present. This is now also supported by
Nuitka.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wrong optimization of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code> on C++
level.</p>
<p>While it’s not done during Nuitka optimization, the rich comparison
helpers still contained short cuts for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">==</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!=</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;=</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka-python</span> <span class="pre">--python-version</span> <span class="pre">3.2</span></code> was
still <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code>.</p>
<p>When determining the value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> the CPython library
code looks at the name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> had received. It was <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> in
all cases, but now it depends on the running version, so it
propagates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keyword only functions with default values were losing references to
defaults.</p>

<p>This is of course quite huge, and unfortunately wasn’t covered by any

the problematic statements. Only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try/finally</span></code> does. The enhanced

code. They are now also propagated from all kinds of expressions.
Previously this was more limited. An assertion added will make sure
that all raises are propagated. Also finally, raise expressions are
converted into raise statements, but without any normalization.</p>

</div>
<p>There is more examples, where the raise propagation is new, but you
get the idea.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conditional expression nodes are now optimized according to the truth
value of the condition, and not only for compile time constants. This
covers e.g. container creations, and other things.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># This was already optimized, as it&#39;s a compile time constant.</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is simply taking advantage of infrastructure that now exists.
Each node kind can overload “getTruthValue” and benefit from it. Help
would be welcome to review which ones can be added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Function creations only have side effects, when their defaults or
annotations (Python3) do. This allows to remove them entirely, should
they be found to be unused.</p></li>
<li><p>Code generation for constants now shares element values used in
tuples.</p>
<p>The general case is currently too complex to solve, but we now make
sure constant tuples (as e.g. used in the default value for the
compiled function), and string constants share the value. This should
reduce memory usage and speed up program start-up.</p>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id378" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Optimization was initially designed around visitors that each did one
thing, and did it well. It turns out though, that this approach is
unnecessary, and constraint collection, allows for the most
consistent results. All remaining optimization has been merged into
constraint collection.</p></li>
<li><p>The names of modules containing node classes were harmonized to
always be plural. In the beginning, this was used to convey the
information that only a single node kind would be contained, but that
has long changed, and is unimportant information.</p></li>
<li><p>The class names of nodes were stripped from the “CPython” prefix.
Originally the intent was to express strict correlation to CPython,
but with increasing amounts of re-formulations, this was not used at
all, and it’s also not important enough to dominate the class name.</p></li>
<li><p>The re-formulations performed in tree building have moved out of the
“Building” module, into names “ReformulationClasses” e.g., so they
are easier to locate and review. Helpers for node building are now in
a separate module, and generally it’s much easier to find the content
of interest now.</p></li>

<li><p>For nested exceptions and interactions with generator objects, the

They now are.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range</span></code> builtin was not raising exceptions if given arguments
appeared to not have side effects, but were still illegal, e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range([],</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">-1)</span></code> was optimized away if the value was not used.</p></li>

arguments. Star arguments could collide with normal ones.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__doc__</span></code> of classes is now only set, where it was in fact

<li><p>The specialty of CPython2.6 yielding non-None values of lambda

been moved into the early tree building. So far it was done during
code generation, making it invisible to the optimization stages.</p></li>

make up for non-inheritance of similar node kinds, but since we have
function references, the structure got so clean, it’s no more needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduced new package <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.tree</span></code>, where the building of node
trees, and operations on them live, as well as recursion and variable

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id388" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks a milestone. The support of Python3 is here. The
re-formulation of complex calls, and the code generation improvements
are quite huge. More re-formulation could be done for argument parsing,
but generally this is now mostly complete.</p>
<p>The 0.3.x series had a lot releases. Many of which brought progress with
re-formulations that aimed at making optimization easier or possible.
Sometimes small things like making “return None” explicit. Sometimes
bigger things, like making class creations normal functions, or getting
rid of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code>. All of this was important ground work, to
make sure, that optimization doesn’t deal with complex stuff.</p>
<p>So, the 0.4.x series begins with this. The focus from now on can be
almost purely optimization. This release contains already some of it,
with frames being optimized away, with the assignment keepers from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> re-formulation being optimized away. This will be
about achieving goals from the “ctypes” plan as discussed in the
Developer Manual.</p>
<p>Also the performance page will be expanded with more benchmarks and
diagrams as I go forward. I have finally given up on “codespeed”, and do
my own diagrams.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.25<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-25" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release brings about changes on all fronts, bug fixes, new
features. Also very importantly Nuitka no longer uses C++11 for its
code, but mere C++03. There is new re-formulation work, and re-factoring
of functions.</p>
<p>But the most important part is this: Mercurial unit tests are working.
Nearly. With the usual disclaimer of me being wrong, all remaining
errors are errors of the test, or minor things. Hope is that these unit
tests can be added as release tests to Nuitka. And once that is done,
the next big Python application can come.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Local variables were released when an exception was raised that
escaped the local function. They should only be released, after
another exception was raised somewhere.</p></li>

</div>
<p>Both tuples had the same name previously, not the end of the tuple is
marked too. Fixed in 0.3.24.1 already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code> when used read-only in modules in packages was

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id390" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Compiled frames support. Before, Nuitka was creating frames with the
standard CPython C/API functions, and tried its best to cache them.
This involved some difficulties, but as it turns out, it is actually
possible to instead provide a compatible type of our own, that we
have full control over.</p>
<p>This will become the base of enhanced compatibility. Keeping
references to local variables attached to exception tracebacks is
something we may be able to solve now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enhanced Python3 support, added support for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nonlocal</span></code> declarations
and many small corrections for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Writable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__defaults__</span></code> attribute for compiled functions, actually
changes the default value used at call time. Not supported is
changing the amount of default parameters.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id391" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Keep the functions along with the module and added “FunctionRef” node
kind to point to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Reformulated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> operators with the conditional
expression construct which makes the “short-circuit” branch.</p></li>
<li><p>Access <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">self</span></code> in methods from the compiled function object instead
of pointer to context object, making it possible to access the
function object.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed “OverflowCheck” module and its usage, avoids one useless scan
per function to determine the need for “locals dictionary”.</p></li>
<li><p>Make “compileTree” of “MainControl” module to only do what the name
says and moved the rest out, making the top level control clearer.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t export module entry points when building executable and not
modules. These exports cause MinGW and MSVC compilers to create
export libraries.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="id392">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id392" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

<li><p>More efficient code for conditional expressions in conditions:</p>

<p>See above, this code is now the typical pattern for each <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id393">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id393" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The remaining uses of C++11 have been removed. Code generated with
Nuitka and complementary C++ code now compile with standard C++03
compilers. This lowers the Nuitka requirements and enables at least
g++ 4.4 to work with Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>The usages of the GNU extension operation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">?:</span> <span class="pre">b</span></code> have replaced
with standard C++ constructs. This is needed to support MSVC which
doesn’t have this.</p></li>
<li><p>Added examples for the typical use cases to the <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html">User Manual</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The “compare_with_cpython” script has gained an option to immediately
remove the Nuitka outputs (build directory and binary) if successful.
Also the temporary files are now put under “/var/tmp” if available.</p></li>
<li><p>Debian package improvements, registering with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doc-base</span></code> the <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html">User
Manual</a> so it is easier
to discover. Also suggest <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mingw32</span></code> package which provides the
cross compiler to Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Partial support for MSVC (Visual Studio 2008 to be exact, the version
that works with CPython2.6 and CPython2.7).</p>
<p>All basic tests that do not use generators are working now, but those
will currently cause crashes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Renamed the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--g++-only</span></code> option to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--c++-only</span></code>.</p>
<p>The old name is no longer correct after clang and MSVC have gained
support, and it could be misunderstood to influence compiler
selection, rather than causing the C++ source code to not be updated,
so manual changes will the used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Catch exceptions for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> only

<h3>New Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id394" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added CPython3.2 test suite as “tests/CPython32” from 3.2.3 and run
it with CPython2.7 to check that Nuitka gives compatible error

be done towards this goal.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id395" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release marks an important point. The compiled frames are exciting
new technology, that will allow even better integration with CPython,
while improving speed. Lowering the requirements to C++03 means, we will
become usable on Android and with MSVC, which will make adoption of
Nuitka on Windows easier for many.</p>
<p>Structurally the outstanding part is the function as references cleanup.
This was a blocker for value propagation, because now functions
references can be copied, whereas previously this was duplicating the
whole function body, which didn’t work, and wasn’t acceptable. Now, work
can resume in this domain.</p>
<p>Also very exciting when it comes to optimization is the remove of
special code for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> operators, as these are now only
mere conditional expressions. Again, this will make value propagation
easier with two special cases less.</p>
<p>And then of course, with Mercurial unit tests running compiled with
Nuitka, an important milestone has been hit.</p>
<p>For a while now, the focus will be on completing Python3 support, XML
based optimization regression tests, benchmarks, and other open ends.
Once that is done, and more certainty about Mercurial tests support, I
may call it a 0.4 and start with local type inference for actual speed
gains.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.24<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-24" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release contains progress on many fronts, except performance.</p>
<p>The extended coverage from running the CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.2
(partially) test suites shows in a couple of bug fixes and general
improvements in compatibility.</p>
<p>Then there is a promised new feature that allows to compile whole
packages.</p>
<p>Also there is more Python3 compatibility, the CPython 3.2 test suite now
succeeds up to “test_builtin.py”, where it finds that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> doesn’t
support the new parameters it has gained, future releases will improve
on this.</p>
<p>And then of course, more re-formulation work, in this case, class
definitions are now mere simple functions. This and later function
references, is the important and only progress towards type inference.</p>

means, instances with methods can now be copied too. Fixed in
0.3.23.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assert</span></code> statement as of Python2.7 creates the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AssertionError</span></code> object from a given value immediately, instead of
delayed as it was with Python2.6. This makes a difference for the
form with 2 arguments, and if the value is a tuple. Fixed in 0.3.23.1
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Sets written like this didn’t work unless they were predicted at
compile time:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">}</span>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id397" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support creating compiled packages. If you give Nuitka a
directory with an “__init__.py” file, it will compile that package
into a “.so” file. Adding the package contents with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--recurse-dir</span></code>
allows to compile complete packages now. Later there will be a
cleaner interface likely, where the later is automatic.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for providing directories as main programs. It’s OK if
they contain a “__main__.py” file, then it’s used instead, otherwise
give compatible error message.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for optimizing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">super</span></code> built-in. It was already
working correctly, but not optimized on CPython2. But for CPython3,
the variant without any arguments required dedicated code.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for optimizing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> built-in under Python2.
It was already working, but will become the basis for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code>

<li><p>For Python3, lots of compatibility work has been done. The Unicode
issues appear to be ironed out now. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">del</span></code> of closure variables

Debian “insecure temp file” bug.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrated “bin/make-dependency-graph.sh” to Python as
“misc/make-dependency-graph.py” and made a more portable and powerful

<p>The filtering is done a more robust way. Also it creates temporary

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id401" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This release brought forward the most important remaining re-formulation
changes needed for Nuitka. Removing class bodies, makes optimization yet
again simpler. Still, making function references, so they can be copied,
is missing for value propagation to progress.</p>
<p>Generally, as usual, a focus has been laid on correctness. This is also
the first time, I am release with a known bug though, one which I
believe now, may be the root cause of the mercurial tests not yet
passing.</p>
<p>The solution will be involved and take a bit of time. It will be about
“compiled frames” and be a (invasive) solution. It likely will make
Nuitka faster too. But this release includes lots of tiny improvements,
for Python3 and also for Python2. So I wanted to get this out now.</p>
<p>As usual, please check it out, and let me know how you fare.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.22<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-22" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release is a continuation of the trend of previous releases, and
added more re-formulations of Python that lower the burden on code
generation and optimization.</p>
<p>It also improves Python3 support substantially. In fact this is the
first release to not only run itself under Python3, but for Nuitka to
<em>compile itself</em> with Nuitka under Python3, which previously only worked
for Python2. For the common language subset, it’s quite fine now.</p>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id409" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid frame stack entries for functions that cannot raise exceptions,
i.e. where they would not be used.</p>
<p>This avoids overhead for the very simple functions. And example of
this can be seen here:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">simple</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len</span></code> built-in for non-constant, but known length values.</p>
<p>An example can be seen here:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># The range isn&#39;t constructed at compile time, but we still know its</span>
<span class="c1"># length.</span>
<span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10000000</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># The string isn&#39;t constructed at compile time, but we still know its</span>
<span class="c1"># length.</span>
<span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># The tuple isn&#39;t constructed, instead it&#39;s known length is used, and</span>
<span class="c1"># side effects are maintained.</span>
<span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">()))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This new optimization applies to all kinds of container creations and
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range</span></code> built-in initially.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize conditions for non-constant, but known truth values.</p>
<p>At this time, known truth values of non-constants means <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range</span></code>
built-in calls with know size and container creations.</p>
<p>An example can be seen here:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,):</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;In Branch&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s clear, that the tuple will be true, we just need to maintain the
side effect, which we do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> operators for known truth values.</p>
<p>See above for what has known truth values currently. This will be
most useful to predict conditions that need not be evaluated at all
due to short circuit nature, and to avoid checking against constant
values. Previously this could not be optimized, but now it can:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># The access and call to &quot;something()&quot; cannot possibly happen</span>
<span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">something</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># Can be replaced with &quot;something()&quot;, as &quot;1&quot; is true. If it had a side</span>
<span class="c1"># effect, it would be maintained.</span>
<span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">something</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># The access and call to &quot;something()&quot; cannot possibly happen, the value</span>
<span class="c1"># is already decided, it&#39;s &quot;1&quot;.</span>
<span class="mi">1</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">something</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># Can be replaced with &quot;something()&quot;, as &quot;0&quot; is false. If it had a side</span>
<span class="c1"># effect, it would be maintained.</span>
<span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">something</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize print arguments to become strings.</p>
<p>The arguments to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> statements are now converted to strings at
compile time if possible.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Combine print arguments to single ones.</p>
<p>When multiple strings are printed, these are now combined.</p>

<p>This release offers enhanced compatibility with Python3, as well as the
solution to many structural problems. Calculating lengths of large
non-constant values at compile time, is technically a break through, as
is avoiding lengthy calculations. The frame guards as nodes is a huge
improvement, making that costly operational possible to be optimized
away.</p>

enough to enable, but we are seeing the glimpse of it already. Not for
long, and looking at numbers will make sense.</p>

<p>This releases contains some really major enhancements, all heading

forms are now all simple and explicit, and as a result, now it will be
easy to start tracking them.</p>
<p>Contractions have become functions internally, with statements use
temporary variables, complex unpacking statement were reduced to more
simple ones, etc.</p>
<p>Also there are the usual few small bug fixes, and a bunch of
organisational improvements, that make the release complete.</p>
<div class="section" id="id414">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id414" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next</span></code> could causes a program crash when iterating
past the end of an iterator. Fixed in 0.3.20.1 already.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span></code> constants could cause a compiler error, as that type was
not considered in the “mutable” check yet. Fixed in 0.3.20.2 already.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance regression. Optimize expression for exception types
caught as well again, this was lost in last release.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions that contain <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code>, are supposed to have a writable
locals. But when removing that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> statement as part of
optimization, this property of the function could get lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The so called “overflow functions” are once again correctly handled.
These once were left behind in some refactoring and had not been
repaired until now. An overflow function is a nested function with an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> or a star import.</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax error for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> outside of a function, was not given,
instead the code returned at run time. Fixed to raise a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code> at compile time.</p></li>

and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">raise</span></code>. Code that follows these statements, or conditional

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

<li><p>Detect module variables as “read only” after all writes have been
detected to not be executed as removed. Previously the “read only
indicator” was determined only once and then stayed the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Expanded conditional statement optimization to detect cases, where
condition is a compile time constant, not just a constant value.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize away assignments from a variable to the same variable, they
have no effect. The potential side effect of accessing the variable
is left intact though, so exceptions will be raised still.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>An exception is where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">len</span></code> actually does have an impact,
because that variable becomes assignable. The “compile itself”
test of Nuitka found that to happen with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.__past__</span></code> module.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Created Python3 variant of quick <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> string access, there was
no such thing in the CPython C/API, but we make the distinction in
the source code, so it makes sense to have it.</p></li>
<li><p>Created an optimized implementation for the built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iter</span></code> with 2
parameters as well. This allows for slightly more efficient code to
be created with regards to reference handling, rather than using the
CPython C/API.</p></li>
<li><p>For all types of variable assigned in the generated code, there are
now methods that accept already taken references or not, and the code
generator picks the optimal variant. This avoids the drop of
references, that e.g. the local variable will insist to take.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use a “context” object for generator functions (and generator
expressions) that don’t need one. And even if it does to store e.g.
the given parameter values, avoid to have a “common context” if there
is no closure taken. This avoids useless <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc</span></code> calls and speeds
up repeated generator object creation.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id417" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Changed complex assignments, i.e. assignments with multiple targets
to such using a temporary variable and multiple simple assignments
instead.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span>

<p>In CPython, when one assignment raises an exception, the whole thing
is aborted, so the complexity of having multiple targets is no more
needed, now that we have temporary variables in a block.</p>
<p>All that was really needed, was to evaluate the complete source
expression only once, but that made code generation contain ugly
loops that are no more needed.</p>

</div>
<p>In reality, not really <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next</span></code> is used, as it wouldn’t raise the
correct exception for unpacking, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finished</span></code> check is more
condensed into it.</p>
<p>Generally this cleanup allowed that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AssignTargetTuple</span></code> and
associated code generation was removed, and in the future value
propagation may optimize these <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iter</span></code> calls away where
possible. At this time, this is not done yet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exception handlers assign caught exception value through assignment
statement.</p>
<p>Previously the code generated for assigning from the caught exception
was not considered part of the handler. It now is the first statement
of an exception handler or not present, this way it may be optimized
as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exception handlers now explicitly catch more than one type.</p>
<p>Catching multiple types worked by merits of the created tuple object
working with the Python C/API function called, but that was not
explicit at all. Now every handler has a tuple of exceptions it
catches, which may only be one, or if None, it’s all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contractions are now functions as well.</p>
<p>Contractions (list, dict, and set) are now re-formulated as function
bodies that contain for loops and conditional statements. This
allowed to remove a lot of special code that dealt with them and will
make these easier to understand for optimization and value
propagation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Global is handled during tree building.</p>
<p>Previously the global statement was its own node, which got removed
during the optimization phase in a dedicated early optimization that
applied its effect, and then removed the node.</p>
<p>It was determined, that there is no reason to not immediately apply
the effect of the global variable and take closure variables and add
them to the provider of that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">global</span></code> statement, allowing to remove
the node class.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Read only module variable detection integrated to constraint
collection.</p>
<p>The detection of read only module variables was so far done as a
separate step, which is no more necessary as the constraint
collection tracks the usages of module variables anyway, so this
separate and slow step could be removed.</p>

<h3>New Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id418" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added test to cover order of calls for complex assignments that
unpack, to see that they make a fresh iterator for each part of a
complex assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Added test that unpacks in an exception catch. It worked, due to the
generic handling of assignment targets by Nuitka, and I didn’t even

<p>Will assign <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a=1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b=2</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added test to cover return statements on module level and class
level, they both must give syntax errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover exceptions from accessing unassigned global names.</p></li>
<li><p>Added syntax test to show that star imports do not allow other names

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id421" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support for disabling the console for Windows binaries. Thanks
for the patch go to Michael H Kent.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced Python3 support for syntax errors, these are now also
compatible.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for macOS X was added.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for using the clang compiler was added, it can be enforced

allow testing the “macOS X” support as good as possible under Linux.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id422">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id422" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Enhanced all optimization that previously worked on “constants” to
work on “compile time constants” instead. A “compile time constant”
can currently also be any form of a built-in name or exception
reference. It is intended to expand this in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for built-ins <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oct</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hex</span></code>, which also
can be computed at compile time, if their arguments are compile time
constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iter</span></code> built-in in both forms, one and two
arguments. These cannot be computed at compile time, but now will
execute faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next</span></code> built-in, also in its both forms, one
and two arguments. These also cannot be computed at compile time, but
now will execute faster as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open</span></code> built-in in all its form. We intend
for future releases to be able to track file opens for including them
into the executable if data files.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__debug__</span></code> built-in constant as well. It cannot be
assigned, yet code can determine a mode of operation from it, and
apparently some code does. When compiling the mode is decided.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ellipsis</span></code> built-in constant as well. It falls in the
same category as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>, i.e. names of
built-in constants that a singletons.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for anonymous built-in references, i.e. built-ins which
have names that are not normally accessible. An example is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type(None)</span></code> which is not accessible from anywhere. Other examples
of such names are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compiled_method_or_function</span></code>.</p>
<p>Having these as represented internally, and flagged as “compile time
constants”, allows the compiler to make more compile time
optimization and to generate more efficient C++ code for it that
won’t e.g. call the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type</span></code> built-in with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> as an argument.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All built-in names used in the program are now converted to “built-in
name references” in a first step. Unsupported built-ins like e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zip</span></code>, for which Nuitka has no own code or understanding yet,
remained as “module variables”, which made access to them slow, and
difficult to recognize.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for module attributes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__file__</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__doc__</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__package__</span></code> if they are read only. It’s the same as was done
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code> so far only.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for slices and subscripts of “compile time
constant” values. These will play a more important role, once value
propagation makes them more frequent.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id423">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id423" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Created a “change log” from the previous release announcements. It’s
as ReStructured Text and converted to PDF for the release as well,
but I chose not to include that in Debian, because it’s so easy to
generate the PDF on that yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>The posting of release announcements is now prepared by a script that
converts the ReStructured Text to HTML and adds it to Wordpress as a
draft posting or updates it, until it’s release time. Simple, sweet
and elegant.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id424">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id424" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Split out the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.nodes.Nodes</span></code> module into many topic nodes, so
that there are now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.nodes.BoolNodes</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.nodes.LoopNodes</span></code> to host nodes of similar kinds, so that it
is now cleaner.</p></li>
<li><p>Split <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">del</span></code> statements into their own node kind, and use much
simpler node structures for them. The following blocks are absolutely
the same:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span>
<span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So that’s now represented in the node tree. And even more complex
looking cases, like this one, also the same:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This one gives a different parse tree, but the same bytecode. And so
Nuitka need no longer concern itself with this at all, and can remove
the tuple from the parse tree immediately. That makes them easy to
handle. As you may have noted already, it also means, there is no way
to enforce that two things are deleted or none at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Turned the function and class builder statements into mere assignment
statements, where defaults and base classes are handled by wrapping
expressions.</p>
<p>Previously they are also kind of assignment statements too, which is
not needed. Now they were reduced to only handle the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bases</span></code> for
classes and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">defaults</span></code> for functions and make optional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Refactored the decorator handling to the tree building stage,
presenting them as function calls on “function body expression” or
class body expression”.</p>
<p>This allowed to remove the special code for decorators from code
generation and C++ templates, making decorations easy subjects for
future optimization, as they practically are now just function calls.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nd">@some_classdecorator</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">C</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nd">@staticmethod</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s just a different form of writing things. Nothing requires the
implementation of decorators, it’s just functions calls with function
bodies before the assignment.</p>
<p>The following is only similar:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">C</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>

    <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">staticmethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">some_classdecorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s only similar, because the assignment to an intermediate value of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code> is not done, and if an exception was raised by the
decoration, that name could persist. For Nuitka, the function and
class body, before having a name, are an expression, and so can of
course be passed to decorators already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The in-place assignments statements are now handled using temporary
variable blocks</p>
<p>Adding support for scoped temporary variables and references to them,
it was possible to re-formulate in-place assignments expressions as
normal look-ups, in-place operation call and then assignment
statement. This allowed to remove static templates and will yield
even better generated code in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The for loop used to have has a “source” expression as child, and the
iterator over it was only taken at the code generation level, so that
step was therefore invisible to optimization. Moved it to tree
building stage instead, where optimization can work on it then.</p></li>
<li><p>Tree building now generally allows statement sequences to be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>
everywhere, and pass statements are immediately eliminated from them
immediately. Empty statement sequences are now forbidden to exist.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved the optimization for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code> to compute node of variable
references, where it doesn’t need anything complex to replace with
the constant value if it’s only read.</p></li>
<li><p>Added new bases classes and mix-in classes dedicated to expressions,
giving a place for some defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>Made the built-in code more reusable.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id426" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The decorator and building changes, the assignment changes, and the node
cleanups are all very important progress for the type inference work,
because they remove special casing the that previously would have been
required. Lambdas and functions now really are the same thing right
after tree building. The in-place assignments are now merely done using
standard assignment code, the built functions and classes are now
assigned to names in assignment statements, much <em>more</em> consistency
there.</p>
<p>Yet, even more work will be needed in the same direction. There may e.g.
be work required to cover <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span></code> statements as well. And assignments
will become no more complex than unpacking from a temporary variable.</p>
<p>For this release, there is only minimal progress on the Python3 front,
despite the syntax support, which is only minuscule progress. The
remaining tasks appear all more or less difficult work that I don’t want
to touch now.</p>
<p>There are still remaining steps, but we can foresee that a release may
be done that finally actually does type inference and becomes the
effective Python compiler this project is all about.</p>

<li><p>Code to detect already considered packages detection was not portable
to Windows, for one case, there was still a use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code> instead of

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id430" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Simplified the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CPythonExpressionComparison</span></code> node, it now always
has only 2 operands.</p>
<p>If there are more, the so called “comparison chain”, it’s done via
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> with assignments to temporary variables, which are expressed
by a new node type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CPythonExpressionTempVariableRef</span></code>. This allowed
to remove <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">expression_temps</span></code> from C++ code templates and
generation, reducing the overall complexity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When executing a module (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--execute</span></code> but not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--exe</span></code>), no longer
does Nuitka import it into itself, instead a new interpreter is
launched with a fresh environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The calls to the variadic <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAKE_TUPLE</span></code> were replaced with calls the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAKE_TUPLExx</span></code> (where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">xx</span></code> is the number of arguments), that are
generated on a as-needed basis. This gives more readable code,
because no <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EVAL_ORDERED_xx</span></code> is needed at call site anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>Many node classes have moved to new modules in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.nodes</span></code> and
grouped by theme. That makes them more accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>The choosing of the debug python has moved from Scons to Nuitka
itself. That way it can respect the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.abiflags</span></code> and works with
Python3.</p></li>
<li><p>The replacing of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> in filenames was made more robust. No longer
is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.replace</span></code> used, but instead proper means to assure that
having <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> as other parts of the filenames won’t be a trouble.</p></li>
<li><p>Module recursion was changed into its own module, instead of being
hidden in the optimization that considers import statements.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, some PyLint work, and some minor <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> were solved.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id433" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This releases contains many changes. The “temporary variable ref” and
“assignment expression” work is ground breaking. I foresee that it will
lead to even more simplifications of code generation in the future, when
e.g. in-place assignments can be reduced to assignments to temporary
variables and conditional statements.</p>
<p>While there were many improvements related to Windows support and fixing
portability bugs, or the Debian package, the real focus is the
optimization work, which will ultimately end with “value propagation”
working.</p>
<p>These are the real focus. The old comparison chain handling was a big
wart. Working, but no way understood by any form of analysis in Nuitka.
Now they have a structure which makes their code generation based on
semantics and allows for future optimization to see through them.</p>
<p>Going down this route is an important preparatory step. And there will
be more work like this needed. Consider e.g. handling of in-place
assignments. With an “assignment expression” to a “temporary variable
ref”, these become the same as user code using such a variable. There
will be more of these to find.</p>
<p>So, that is where the focus is. The release now was mostly aiming at
getting involved fixes out. The bug fixed by comparison chain reworking,
and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__</span></code> related one, were not suitable for hot fix
releases, so that is why the 0.3.19 release had to occur now. But with
plugin support, with this comparison chain cleanup, with improved
Python3 support, and so on, there was plenty of good stuff already, also
worth to get out.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.18<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-18" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time
there are a few bug fixes, and the important step that triggered the
release: Nuitka has entered Debian Unstable. So you if want, you will
get stable Nuitka releases from now on via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">nuitka</span></code>.</p>
<p>The release cycle was too short to have much focus. It merely includes
fixes, which were available as hot fixes, and some additional
optimization and node tree cleanups, as well as source cleanups. But not
much else.</p>
<div class="section" id="id434">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id434" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Conditional statements with both branches empty were not optimized
away in all cases, triggering an assertion of code generation.
Released as 0.3.17a hot fix already.</p></li>
<li><p>Nuitka was considering directories to contain packages that had no
“__init__.py” which could lead to errors when it couldn’t find the
package later in the compilation process. Released as 0.3.17a hot fix
already.</p></li>
<li><p>When providing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals()</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> statements, this was not
making the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals()</span></code> writable. The logic to detect the case that
default value is used (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>) and be pessimistic about it, didn’t
consider the actual value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals()</span></code>. Released as 0.3.17b hot fix
already.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility Fix: When no defaults are given, CPython uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">func.func_defaults</span></code>, but Nuitka had been using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id435">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id435" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the condition of assert statements can be predicted, these are now
optimized in a static raise or removed.</p></li>
<li><p>For built-in name references, there is now dedicated code to look
them up, that doesn’t check the module level at all. Currently these
are used in only a few cases though.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaner code is generated for the simple case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code>
statements. This is not only faster code, it’s also more readable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id436">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id436" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Removed the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CPythonStatementAssert</span></code> node.</p>
<p>It’s not needed, instead at tree building, assert statements are
converted to conditional statements with the asserted condition
result inverted and a raise statement with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AssertionError</span></code> and the
assertion argument.</p>
<p>This allowed to remove code and complexity from the subsequent steps
of Nuitka, and enabled existing optimization to work on assert
statements as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moved built-in exception names and built-in names to a new module
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.Builtins</span></code> instead of having in other places. This was
previously a bit spread-out and misplaced.</p></li>
<li><p>Added cumulative <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags</span></code> to node classes for use in checks. Use it
annotate which node kinds to visit in e.g. per scope finalization
steps. That avoids kinds and class checks.</p></li>
<li><p>New node for built-in name lookups</p>
<p>This allowed to remove tricks played with adding module variable
lookups for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">staticmethod</span></code> when adding them for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__new__</span></code> or
module variable lookups for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> when predicting the result of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type('a')</span></code>, which was unlikely to cause a problem, but an
important <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> item still.</p>

finally updated for releases automatically.</p>
<p>Up to this release, I had to manually edit that page, but now
mastered the art of upload via XMLRCP and a Python script, so that

</li>
<li><p>The Debian package is backportable to Ubuntu Natty, Maverick,

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id439" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This releases contains not as much changes as others, mostly because
it’s the intended base for a Debian upload.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> fix was detected by continued work on the branch
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">feature/minimize_CPython26_tests_diff</span></code> branch, but that work is now
complete.</p>
<p>It is being made pretty (many git rebase iterations) with lots of Issues
being added to the bug tracker and referenced for each change. The
intention is to have a clean commits repository with the changed made.</p>
<p>But of course, the real excitement is the “type inference” work. It will
give a huge boost to Nuitka. With this in place, new benchmarks may make
sense. I am working on getting it off the ground, but also to make us
more efficient.</p>
<p>So when I learn something. e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assert</span></code> is not special, I apply it to
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">develop</span></code> branch immediately, to keep the differences as small as
possible, and to immediately benefit from such improvements.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.17<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-17" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time
there are a few bug fixes, lots of very important organisational work,
and yet again improved compatibility and cleanups. Also huge is the
advance in making <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code> go away and making the recursion of Nuitka
controllable, which means a lot for scalability of projects that use a
lot of packages that use other packages, because now you can choose
which ones to embed and which ones one.</p>
<p>The release cycle had a focus on improving the quality of the test
scripts, the packaging, and generally to prepare the work on “type
inference” in a new feature branch.</p>
<p>I have also continued to work towards CPython3.2 compatibility, and this
version, while not there, supports Python3 with a large subset of the
basic tests programs running fine (of course via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2to3</span></code> conversion)
without trouble. There is still work to do, exceptions don’t seem to
work fully yet, parameter parsing seems to have changed, etc. but it
seems that CPython3.2 is going to work one day.</p>
<p>And there has been a lot of effort, to address the Debian packaging to
be cleaner and more complete, addressing issues that prevented it from
entering the Debian repository.</p>

when many modules were embedded, Christopher Tott provided a fix for
it. Released as 0.3.16a hot fix already.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix, avoid to introduce new variables for where built-in exception
references are sufficient. Released as 0.3.16b hot fix already.</p></li>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id441" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Enhanced compatibility again, provide enough <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">co_varnames</span></code> in the
code objects, so that slicing them up to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">code_object.co_argcount</span></code>
will work. They are needed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspect</span></code> module and might be used by

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id442" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>Eliminate near empty statement sequences (only contain a pass

constructs.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the pickle “protocol 2” on CPython2 except for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code>
strings where it does not work well. It gives a more compressed and
binary representation, that is generally more efficient to un-stream

It’s incomplete, but it details some of the existing stuff, coding
rules, plans for “type inference”, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> output to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metavar</span></code> where applicable.
This makes it more readable for some options.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of error message, give help output when no module or program
file name was given. This makes Nuitka help out more convenient.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistently use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#!/usr/bin/env</span> <span class="pre">python</span></code> for all scripts, this was
previously only done for some of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Ported the PyLint check script to Python as well, enhancing it on the
way to check the exit code, and to only output changes things, as
well as making the output of warnings for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> items optional.</p></li>
<li><p>All scripts used for testing, PyLint checking, etc. now work with
Python3 as well. Most useful on Arch Linux, where it’s also already
the default for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Python</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The help output of Nuitka was polished a lot more. It is now more
readable and uses option groups to combine related options together.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the tests run without any dependence on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PATH</span></code> to contain the
executables of Nuitka. This makes it easier to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Add license texts to 3rd party file that were missing them, apply
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">licensecheck</span></code> results to cleanup Nuitka. Also removed own
copyright statement from in-line copy of Scons, it had been added by
accident only.</p></li>
<li><p>Release the tests that I own as well as the Debian packaging I
created under “Apache License 2.0” which is very liberal, meaning
every project will be able to use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t require copyright assignment for contributions anymore, instead
only “Apache License 2.0”, the future Nuitka license, so that the
code won’t be a problem when changing the license of all of Nuitka to
that license.</p></li>
<li><p>Give contributors listed in the <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html">User Manual</a> an exception to the GPL
terms until Nuitka is licensed under “Apache License 2.0” as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--experimental</span></code> option which can be used to control
experimental features, like the one currently being added on branch
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">feature/ctypes_annotation</span></code>, where “type inference” is currently
only activated when that option is given. For this stable release, it
does nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the static C++ files of Nuitka with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cppcheck</span></code> as well.
Didn’t find anything.</p></li>

Changed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> boolean operators to a new base class, and
making their interface more similar to that of operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Added cumulative <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags</span></code> to node classes for use in checks. Use it
annotate which node kinds to visit in e.g. per scope finalization
steps. That avoids kinds and class checks.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced the “visitor” interface to provide more kinds of callbacks,
enhanced the way “each scope” visiting is achieved by generalizing is
as “child has not tag ‘closure_taker’” and that for every “node that
has tag ‘closure_taker’”.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxHighlighting</span></code> module to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.gui</span></code> package where
it belongs.</p></li>
<li><p>More white listing work for imports. As recursion is now the default,
and leads to warnings for non-existent modules, the CPython tests
gave a lot of good candidates for import errors that were white
listed.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistently use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka</span></code> in test scripts, as there isn’t a

This is to prevent false positives, where a test passes, but only
because it fails in CPython early on and then does so with Nuitka
too. For the syntax tests we make sure they fail.</p></li>
<li><p>The basic tests can now be run with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PYTHON=python3.2</span></code> and use

run from the release test script <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">check-release</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Include the syntax tests in release tests as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed many existing tests so that they can run under CPython3 too.
Of course this is via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2to3</span></code> conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t fail if the CPython test suites are not there.</p>
<p>Currently they remain largely unpublished, and as such are mostly
only available to me (exception,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">feature/minimize_CPython26_tests_diff</span></code> branch references the
CPython2.6 tests repository, but that remains work in progress).</p>

<li><p>For the compile itself test: Make the presence of the Scons in-line
copy optional, the Debian package doesn’t contain it.</p></li>
<li><p>Also make it more portable, so it runs under Windows too, and allow
to choose the Python version to test. Check this test with both
CPython2.6 and CPython2.7 not only the default Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Before releasing, test that the created Debian package builds fine in
a minimal Debian <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unstable</span></code> chroot, and passes all the tests
included in the package (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">basics</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">syntax</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">programs</span></code>,

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id446" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The “git flow” was used again in this release cycle and proved to be
useful not only for hot fix, but also for creating the branch
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">feature/ctypes_annotation</span></code> and rebasing it often while things are
still flowing.</p>
<p>The few hot fixes didn’t require a new release, but the many
organisational improvements and the new features did warrant the new
release, because of e.g. the much better test handling in this release
and the improved recursion control.</p>
<p>The work on Python3 support has slowed down a bit. I mostly only added
some bits for compatibility, but generally it has slowed down. I wanted
to make sure it doesn’t regress by accident, so running with CPython3.2
is now part of the normal release tests.</p>
<p>What’s still missing is more “hg” completeness. Only the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">co_varnames</span></code>
work for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspect</span></code> was going in that direction, and this has slowed
down. It was more important to make Nuitka’s recursion more accessible
with the new options, so that was done first.</p>
<p>And of course, the real excitement is the “type inference” work. It will
give a huge boost to Nuitka, and I am happy that it seems to go well.
With this in place, new benchmarks may make sense. I am working on
getting it off the ground, so other people can work on it too. My idea
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></code> native calls may become true sooner than expected. To
support that, I would like to add more tools to make sure we discover
changes earlier on, checking the XML representations of tests to
discover improvements and regressions more clearly.</p>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id453" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The “git flow” was really great in this release cycle. There were many
hot fix releases being made, so that the bugs could be addressed
immediately without requiring the overhead of a full release. I believe
that this makes Nuitka clearly one of the best supported projects.</p>
<p>This quick turn-around also encourages people to report more bugs, which
is only good. And the structure is there to hold it. Of course, the many
bug fixes meant that there is not as much new development, but that is
not the priority, correctness is.</p>
<p>The work on Python3 is a bit strange. I don’t need Python3 at all. I
also believe it is that evil project to remove cruft from the Python
core and make developers of all relevant Python software, add
compatibility cruft to their software instead. Yet, I can’t really stop
to work on it. It has that appeal of small fixups here and there, and
then something else works too.</p>
<p>Python3 work is like when I was first struggling with Nuitka to pass the
CPython2 unit tests for a first time. It’s fun. And then it finds real
actual bugs that apply to CPython2 too. Not doing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Py_Finalize</span></code> (but
having to), the slice operations shortcomings, the bug of subscript
in-place, and so on. There is likely more things hidden, and the earlier
Python3 is supported, the more benefit from increased test covered.</p>
<p>What’s missing is more “hg” completeness. I think only the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">raise</span></code>
without exception set and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">func_defaults</span></code> issue were going into
its direction, but it won’t be enough yet.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.15<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-15" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time
again many organisational improvements, some bug fixes, much improved
compatibility and cleanups.</p>
<p>This release cycle had a focus on packaging Nuitka for easier
consumption, i.e. automatic packaging, making automatic uploads,
improvement documentation, and generally cleaning things up, so that
Nuitka becomes more compatible and ultimately capable to run the “hg”
test suite. It’s not there yet, but this is a huge jump for usability of
Nuitka and its compatibility, again.</p>
<p>Then lots of changes that make Nuitka approach Python3 support, the
generated C++ for at least one large example is compiling with this new
release. It won’t link, but there will be later releases.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of cleanup going on, geared towards compatibility
with line numbers in the frame object.</p>

<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id454" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The main module was using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__main__</span></code> in tracebacks, but it must be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;module&gt;</span></code>. Released as 0.3.14a hot fix already.</p></li>
<li><p>Workaround for “execfile cannot be used as an expression”. It wasn’t
possible to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execfile</span></code> in an expression, only as a statement.</p>
<p>But then there is crazy enough code in e.g. mercurial that uses it in
a lambda function, which made the issue more prominent. The fix now
allows it to be an expression, except on the class level, which
wasn’t seen yet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The in-line copy of Scons was not complete enough to work for
“Windows” or with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--windows-target</span></code> for cross compile. Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Cached frames didn’t release the “back” frame, therefore holding
variables of these longer than CPython does, which could cause
ordering problems. Fixed for increased compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle “yield outside of function” syntax error in compiled source
correctly. This one was giving a Nuitka backtrace, now it gives a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SyntaxError</span></code> as it needs to.</p></li>
<li><p>Made syntax/indentation error output absolutely identical to CPython.</p></li>

<li><p>Including the generated “README.pdf” in the distribution archives, so

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id458" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Using the frame objects to store current line of execution avoids the
need to store it away in helper code at all. It ought to also help a
lot with threading support, and makes Nuitka even more compatible,
because now line numbers will be correct even outside tracebacks, but
for mere stack frame dumps.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for_return</span></code> detection from code generation to tree
building where it belongs. Yield statements used as return statements
need slightly different code for Python2.6 difference. That solved an
old <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Much Python3 portability work. Sometimes even improving existing
code, the Python compiler code had picked up a few points, where the
latest Nuitka didn’t work with Python3 anymore, when put to actual
compile.</p>
<p>The test covered only syntax, but e.g. meta classes need different
code in CPython3, and that’s now supported. Also helper code was made
portable in more places, but not yet fully. This will need more work.</p>

<li><p>Cleaned up uses of debug defines, so they are now more consistent and

of issues Nuitka had, but went unnoticed so far, and triggered e.g.
the frame line number improvements.</p></li>

updated and uploaded. From here on, there can be such packages for the
hot fix releases too.</p>
<p>The exception tracebacks are now correct by design, and better covered.</p>
<p>The generator performance work showed that the approach taken by Nuitka
is in fact fast. It was fast on ARM already, but it’s nice to see that
it’s now also fast on x64. Programs using generators will be affected a
lot by this.</p>
<p>Overall, this release brings Nuitka closer to usability. Better binary
names, man pages, improved documentation, issue tracker, etc. all there
now. I am in fact now looking for a sponsor for the Debian package to
upload it into Debian directly.</p>

not attributes of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">func_code</span></code> are meaningful yet, but in theory can be

CPython does. Fixed in 0.3.12a already.</p></li>
<li><p>The star import (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code>) didn’t work for submodules.

true of “PyQt” with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">port_v3</span></code> included. These files contain Python3
syntax and fail to be imported in Python2, but that is not to be
considered an error. These modules are now skipped with a warning.
Fixed in 0.3.12b already.</p></li>
<li><p>The code to import modules wasn’t using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__</span></code> built-in,
which prevented <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__</span></code> overriding code to work. Changed
import to use the built-in. Fixed in 0.3.12c already.</p></li>
<li><p>The code generated for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__</span></code> built-in with constant
values was doing relative imports only. It needs to attempt relative
and absolute imports. Fixed in 0.3.12c already.</p></li>
<li><p>The code of packages in “__init__.py” believed it was outside of the
package, giving problems for package local imports. Fixed in 0.3.12d
already.</p></li>
<li><p>It appears that “Scons”, which Nuitka uses internally and transparent
to you, to execute the compilation and linking tasks, was sometimes
not building the binaries or shared libraries, due to a false
caching. As a workaround, these are now erased before doing the
build. Fixed in 0.3.12d already.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> in comparison chains (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span>
<span class="pre">c</span></code> is one), wasn’t supported yet. The use of these in comparison
chains <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">b</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">c</span></code> is very strange.</p>
<p>Only in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test_grammar.py</span></code> it was ever used I believe. Anyway,
it’s supported now, solving this <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> and reducing the
difference. Fixed in 0.3.12e already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The order of evaluation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> operators wasn’t
enforced in a portable way. Now it is correct on “ARM” too. Fixed in
0.3.12e already.</p></li>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.12<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-12" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka many bug fixes,
and substantial improvements especially in the organisational area.
There is a new <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html">User Manual</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.pdf">PDF</a>), with much improved
content, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.meta_path</span></code> based import mechanism for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code> mode,
git flow goodness.</p>
<p>This release is generally also the result of working towards compilation
of a real programs (Mercurial) and to get things work more nicely on
Windows by default. Thanks go to Liu Zhenhai for helping me with this
goal.</p>
<p>Due to the use of the “git flow”, most of the bugs listed here were
already fixed in on the stable release before this release. And there
were many of these.</p>
<div class="section" id="id474">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id474" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The order of evaluation for base classes and class dictionaries was
not enforced.</p>
<p>Apparently nothing in the CPython test suite did that, I only noticed
during debugging that Nuitka gave a different error than CPython did,
for a class that had an undefined base class, because both class body
and base classes were giving an error. Fixed in 0.3.11a already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Method objects didn’t hold a reference to the used class.</p>
<p>The effect was only noticed when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--python-debug</span></code> was used, i.e.
the debug version of Python linked, because then the garbage
collector makes searches. Fixed in 0.3.11b already.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> on Linux as well. On Debian it is otherwise
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/python</span></code> which might be a different version of Python
entirely. Fixed in 0.3.11c already.</p></li>
<li><p>Embedded modules inside a package could hide package variables of the
same name. Learned during PyCON DE about this corner case. Fixed in
0.3.11d already.</p></li>
<li><p>Packages could be duplicated internally. This had no effect on
generated code other than appearing twice in the list if frozen
modules. Fixed in 0.3.11d already.</p></li>
<li><p>When embedding modules from outside current directory, the look-up
failed. The embedding only ever worked for the compile itself and
programs test cases, because they are all in the current directory
then. Fixed in 0.3.11e already.</p></li>
<li><p>The check for ARM target broke Windows support in the Scons file.
Fixed in 0.3.11f already.</p></li>
<li><p>The star import from external modules failed with an error in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code> mode. Fixed in 0.3.11g already.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules with a parent package could cause a problem under some
circumstances. Fixed in 0.3.11h already.</p></li>
<li><p>One call variant, with both list and dict star arguments and keyword
arguments, but no positional parameters, didn’t have the required C++
helper function implemented. Fixed in 0.3.11h already.</p></li>
<li><p>The detection of the CPU core count was broken on my hexacore at
least. Gave 36 instead of 6, which is a problem for large programs.
Fixed in 0.3.11h already.</p></li>
<li><p>The in-line copy of Scons didn’t really work on Windows, which was
sad, because we added it to simplify installation on Windows
precisely because of this.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning up the build directory from old sources and object files
wasn’t portable to Windows and therefore wasn’t effective there.</p></li>
<li><p>From imports where part of the imported were found modules and parts
were not, didn’t work. Solved by the feature branch
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">meta_path_import</span></code> that was merged for this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Newer MinGW gave warnings about the default visibility not being
possible to apply to class members. Fixed by not setting this default
visibility anymore on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> gave warnings on Windows because of
backslashes in the path. Using a raw string to prevent such problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard library path was hard coded. Changed to run time
detection.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id475" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Version checks on Python runtime now use a new define
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PYTHON_VERSION</span></code> that makes it easier. I don’t like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PY_VERSION_HEX</span></code>, because it is so unreadable. Makes some of the
checks a lot more safe.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.meta_path</span></code> based import from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">meta_path_import</span></code>
feature branch allowed the cleanup the way importing is done. It’s a
lot less code now.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed some unused code. We will aim at making Nuitka the tool to
detect dead code really.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.Nodes</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.nodes.Nodes</span></code>, that is what the
package is intended for, the split will come later.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="id476">
<h3>New Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id476" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>New tests for import variants that previously didn’t work: Mixed
imports. Imports from a package one level up. Modules hidden by a
package variable, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Added test of function call variant that had no test previously. Only
found it when compiling “hg”. Amazing how nothing in my tests,
CPython tests, etc. used it.</p></li>
<li><p>Added test to cover the partial success of import statements.</p></li>
<li><p>Added test to cover evaluation order of class definitions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id477">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id477" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Migrated the “README.txt” from org-mode to ReStructured Text, which
allows for a more readable document, and to generate a nice <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html">User
Manual</a> in PDF form.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of information in “README.txt” was increased, with many
more subjects are now covered, e.g. “git flow” and how to join Nuitka
development. It’s also impressive to see what code blocks and syntax
highlighting can do for readability.</p></li>
<li><p>The Nuitka git repository has seen multiple hot fixes.</p>
<p>These allowed to publish bug fixes immediately after they were made,
and avoided the need for a new release just to get these out. This
really saves me a lot of time too, because I can postpone releasing
the new version until it makes sense because of other things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then there was a feature branch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">meta_path_import</span></code> that lived until
being merged to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">develop</span></code> to improve the import code, which is now
released as part of the main branch. Getting that feature right took
a while.</p></li>
<li><p>And there is the feature branch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">minimize_CPython26_tests_diff</span></code>
which has some success already in documenting the required changes to
the “CPython26” test suite and in reducing the amount of differences,
while doing it. We have a frame stack working there, albeit in too
ugly code form.</p></li>
<li><p>The release archives are now built using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuptools</span></code>. You can now
also download a zip file, which is probably more Windows friendly.
The intention is to work on that to make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> produce a
Nuitka install that won’t rely on any environment variables at all.
Right now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> won’t even allow any other options than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sdist</span></code> to be given.</p></li>
<li><p>Ported “compile_itself.sh” to “compile_itself.py”, i.e. ported it to
Python. This way, we can execute it easily on Windows too, where it
currently still fails. Replacing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diff</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rm</span> <span class="pre">-rf</span></code>, etc. is a
challenge, but it reduces the dependency on MSYS tools on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The compilation of standard library is disabled by default, but
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dist</span></code> packages are now embedded. To include even
standard library, there is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--really-deep</span></code> option that has to be
given in addition to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code>, which forces this.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id478">
<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id478" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Again, huge progress. The improved import mechanism is very beautiful.
It appears that little is missing to compile real world programs like
“hg” with Nuitka. The next release cycle will focus on that and continue
to improve the Windows support which appears to have some issues.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.11<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-11" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some bug
fixes and portability work.</p>
<p>This release is generally cleaning up things, and makes Nuitka portable
to ARM Linux. I used to host the Nuitka homepage on that machine, but
now that it’s no longer so, I can run heavy compile jobs on it. To my
surprise, it found many portability problems. So I chose to fix that
first, the result being that Nuitka now works on ARM Linux too.</p>
<div class="section" id="id479">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id479" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The order of slice expressions was not correct on x86 as well, and I
found that with new tests only. So the porting to ARM revealed a bug
category, I previously didn’t consider.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">linux2</span></code> in the Scons file is potentially incompatible
with Linux 3.0, although it seems that at least on Debian the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.platform</span></code> was changed back to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">linux2</span></code>. Anyway, it’s
probably best to allow just anything that starts with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">linux</span></code> these
days.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> statement worked like a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> function, i.e. it
first evaluated all printed expressions, and did the output only
then. That is incompatible in case of exceptions, where partial
outputs need to be done, and so that got fixed.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id480" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Function calls now each have a dedicated helper function, avoiding in

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id481" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Moved many C++ helper declarations and in-line implementations to
dedicated header files for better organisation.</p></li>
<li><p>Some dependencies were removed and consolidated to make the
dependency graph sane.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple decorators were in reverse order in the node tree. The code
generation reversed it back, so no bug, yet that was a distorted
tree.</p>
<p>Finding this came from the ARM work, because the “reversal” was in
fact just the argument evaluation order of C++ under x86/x64, but on
ARM that broke. Correcting it highlighted this issue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The deletion of slices, was not using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Py_ssize</span></code> for indexes,
disallowing some kinds of optimization, so that was harmonized.</p></li>
<li><p>The function call code generation got a general overhaul. It is now
more consistent, has more helpers available, and creates more
readable code.</p></li>
<li><p>PyLint is again happier than ever.</p></li>

detect, and in some cases not previously covered at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Executing Nuitka with Python3 (it won’t produce correct Python3 C/API

will be detailed in another <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/posts/nuitka-git-flow.html">separate posting</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an unstable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">develop</span></code> branch in which the development

<p>So this a speedup factor of 258%, last time on another machine it was

<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id485" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Exceptions now correctly stack.</p>
<p>When you catch an exception, there always was the exception set, but
calling a new function, and it catching the exception, the values of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_info()</span></code> didn’t get reset after the function returned.</p>
<p>This was a small difference (of which there are nearly none left now)
but one that might effect existing code, which affects code that
calls functions in exception handling to check something about it.</p>
<p>So it’s good this is resolved now too. Also because it is difficult
to understand, and now it’s just like CPython behaves, which means
that we don’t have to document anything at all about it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> in generator functions got fixed up. I realized that
this wouldn’t work while working on other things. It’s obscure yes,
but it ought to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Lambda generator functions can now be nested and in generator
functions. There were some problems here with the allocation of
closure variables that got resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>List contractions could not be returned by lambda functions. Also a
closure issue.</p></li>
<li><p>When using a mapping for globals to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eval</span></code> that had a
side effect on lookup, it was evident that the lookup was made twice.
Correcting this also improves the performance for the normal case.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id486">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id486" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Statically raised as well as predicted exceptions are propagated
upwards, leading to code and block removal where possible, while
maintaining the side effects.</p>
<p>This is brand new and doesn’t do everything possible yet. Most
notable, the matching of raised exception to handlers is not yet
performed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Built-in exception name references and creation of instances of them
are now optimized as well, which leads to faster exception
raising/catching for these cases.</p></li>
<li><p>More kinds of calls to built-ins are handled, positional parameters
are checked and more built-ins are covered.</p>
<p>Notable is that now checks are performed if you didn’t potentially
overload e.g. the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">len</span></code> with your own version in the module.
Locally it was always detected already. So it’s now also safe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All operations and comparisons are now simulated if possible and
replaced with their result.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of predictable true or false conditions, not taken
branches are removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Empty branches are now removed from most constructs, leading to
sometimes cleaner code generated.</p></li>

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id487" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Removed the lambda body node and replaced it with function body. This
is a great win for the split into body and builder. Regular functions
and lambda functions now only differ in how the created body is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Large cleanup of the operation/comparison code. There is now only use
of a simulator function, which exists for every operator and
comparison. This one is then used in a prediction call, shared with
the built-in predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Tracing</span></code> module to avoid future imports of

<ul>
<li><p>Enhanced <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OverflowFunctions</span></code> test to cover even deeper nesting of
overflow functions taking closure from each level. While it’s not yet
working, this makes clearer what will be needed. Even if this code is

<li><p>Added to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ListContractions</span></code> the case where a contraction is
returned by a lambda function, but still needs to leak its loop
variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GeneratorExpressions</span></code> test to cover lambda generators,
which is really crazy code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">y</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="k">yield</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">yield</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Added to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ExecEval</span></code> a case where the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> is inside a
generator, to cover that too.</p></li>
<li><p>Activated the testing of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_info()</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ExceptionRaising</span></code>
test.</p>
<p>This was previously commented out, and now I added stuff to
illustrate all of the behavior of CPython there.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enhanced <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ComparisonChains</span></code> test to demonstrate that the order of
evaluations is done right and that side effects are maintained.</p></li>
<li><p>Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuiltinOverload</span></code> test to show that overloaded built-ins are
actually called and not the optimized version. So code like this has
to print 2 lines:</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.9<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-9" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is about the new release of Nuitka which some bug fixes and offers
a good speed improvement.</p>
<p>This new release is major milestone 2 work, enhancing practically all
areas of Nuitka. The main focus was on faster function calls, faster
class attributes (not instance), faster unpacking, and more built-ins
detected and more thoroughly optimizing them.</p>
<div class="section" id="id491">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id491" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Exceptions raised inside with statements had references to the
exception and traceback leaked.</p></li>
<li><p>On Windows the binaries <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> pointed to the binary
itself instead of the Python interpreter. Changed, because some code
uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></code> to know how to start Python scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a bug (fixed in their repository) related to C++ raw strings
and C++ “trigraphs” that affects Nuitka, added a workaround that
makes Nuitka not emit “trigraphs” at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The check for mutable constants was erroneous for tuples, which could
lead to assuming a tuple with only mutable elements to be not
mutable, which is of course wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id492">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id492" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This time there are so many new optimization, it makes sense to group
them by the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exceptions">
<h3>Exceptions<a class="headerlink" href="#exceptions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The code to add a traceback is now our own, which made it possible to
use frames that do not contain line numbers and a code object capable
of lookups.</p></li>
<li><p>Raising exceptions or adding to tracebacks has been made way faster
by reusing a cached frame objects for the task.</p></li>
<li><p>The class used for saving exceptions temporarily (e.g. used in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> code, or with statement) has been improved.</p>
<p>It now doesn’t make a copy of the exception with a C++ <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new</span></code> call,
but it simply stores the exception properties itself and creates the
exception object only on demand, which is more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When catching exceptions, the addition of tracebacks is now done
without exporting and re-importing the exception to Python, but
directly on the exception objects traceback, this avoids a useless
round trip.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="function-calls">
<h3>Function Calls<a class="headerlink" href="#function-calls" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Uses of PyObject_Call provide <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NULL</span></code> as the dictionary, instead of
an empty dictionary, which is slightly faster for function calls.</p></li>
<li><p>There are now dedicated variants for complex function calls with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code> arguments in all forms.</p>
<p>These can take advantage of easier cases. For example, a merge with
star arguments is only needed if there actually were any of these.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The check for non-string values in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code> arguments can now be
completely short-cut for the case of a dictionary that has never had
a string added. There is now code that detects this case and skips
the check, eliminating it as a performance concern.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parameter-parsing">
<h3>Parameter Parsing<a class="headerlink" href="#parameter-parsing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Reversed the order in which parameters are checked.</p>
<p>Now the keyword dictionary is iterated first and only then the
positional arguments after that is done. This iteration is not only
much faster (avoiding repeated lookups for each possible parameter),
it also can be more correct, in case the keyword argument is derived
from a dictionary and its keys mutate it when being compared.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Comparing parameter names is now done with a fast path, in which the
pointer values are compare first. This can avoid a call to the
comparison at all, which has become very likely due to the interning
of parameter name strings, see below.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a dedicated call to check for parameter equality with rich
equality comparison, which doesn’t raise an exception.</p></li>
<li><p>Unpacking of tuples is now using dedicated variants of the normal
unpacking code instead of rolling out everything themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attribute-access">
<h3>Attribute Access<a class="headerlink" href="#attribute-access" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The class type (in executables, not yet for extension modules) is
changed to a faster variant of our own making that doesn’t consider
the restricted mode a possibility. This avoids very expensive calls,
and makes accessing class attributes in compiled code and in
non-compiled code faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to attributes (but not of instances) got in-lined and
therefore much faster. Due to other optimization, a specific step to
intern the string used for attribute access is not necessary with
Nuitka at all anymore. This made access to attributes about 50%
faster which is big of course.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constants">
<h3>Constants<a class="headerlink" href="#constants" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The bug for mutable tuples also caused non-mutable tuples to be
considered as mutable, which lead to less efficient code.</p></li>
<li><p>The constant creation with the g++ bug worked around, can now use raw
strings to create string constants, without resorting to un-pickling
them as a work around. This allows us to use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyString_FromStringAndSize</span></code> to create strings again, which is
obviously faster, and had not been done, because of the confusion
caused by the g++ bug.</p></li>
<li><p>For string constants that are usable as attributes (i.e. match the
identifier regular expression), these are now interned, directly
after creation. With this, the check for identical value of pointers
for parameters has a bigger chance to succeed, and this saves some
memory too.</p></li>
<li><p>For empty containers (set, dict, list, tuple) the constants created
are now are not unstreamed, but created with the dedicated API calls,
saving a bit of code and being less ugly.</p></li>
<li><p>For mutable empty constant access (set, dict, list) the values are no
longer made by copying the constant, but instead with the API
functions to create new ones. This makes code like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">[]</span></code> a tiny
bit faster.</p></li>
<li><p>For slice indices the code generation now takes advantage of creating
a C++ <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Py_ssize_t</span></code> from constant value if possible. Before it was
converting the integer constant at run time, which was of course
wasteful even if not (very) slow.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="iteration">
<h3>Iteration<a class="headerlink" href="#iteration" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The creation of iterators got our own code. This avoids a function
call and is otherwise only a small gain for anything but sequence
iterators. These may be much faster to create now, as it avoids
another call and repeated checks.</p></li>
<li><p>The next on iterator got our own code too, which has simpler code
flow, because it avoids the double check in case of NULL returned.</p></li>
<li><p>The unpack check got similar code to the next iterator, it also has
simpler code flow now and avoids double checks.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="built-ins">
<h3>Built-ins<a class="headerlink" href="#built-ins" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added support for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool</span></code> built-ins along with optimizing their use with
constant parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> built-ins, based on a new
“call spec” object, that detects parameter errors at compile time and
raises appropriate exceptions as required, plus it deals with keyword
arguments just as well.</p>
<p>So, to Nuitka it doesn’t matter now it you write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int(value)</span> <span class="pre">``or</span>
<span class="pre">``int(x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">value)</span></code> anymore. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">base</span></code> parameter of these built-ins
is also supported.</p>
<p>The use of this call spec mechanism will the expanded, currently it
is not applied to the built-ins that take only one parameter. This is
a work in progress as is the whole built-ins business as not all the
built-ins are covered yet.</p>

<div class="section" id="id493">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id493" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In 0.3.8 per module global classes were introduced, but the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IMPORT_MODULE</span></code> kept using the old universal class, this got
resolved and the old class is now fully gone.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assertObject</span></code> in more cases, and in more places at all,
catches errors earlier on.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved the addition to tracebacks into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_PythonException</span></code> class,
where it works directly on the contained traceback. This is cleaner
as it no longer requires to export exceptions to Python, just to add
a traceback entry.</p></li>
<li><p>Some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyLint</span></code> cleanups were done, reducing the number of reports a
bit, but there is still a lot to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DefaultValueIdentifier</span></code> class that encapsulates the access
to default values in the parameter parsing more cleanly.</p></li>
<li><p>The module <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeTemplatesListContractions</span></code> was renamed to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeTemplatesContractions</span></code> to reflect the fact that it deals with
all kinds of contractions (also set and dict contractions), not just
list contractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved the with related template to its own module
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeTemplatesWith</span></code>, so its easier to find.</p></li>
<li><p>The options handling for g++ based compilers was cleaned up, so that
g++ 4.6 and MinGW are better supported now.</p></li>
<li><p>Documented more aspects of the Scons build file.</p></li>
<li><p>Some more generated code white space fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>Moved some helpers to dedicated files. There is now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calling.hpp</span></code>
for function calls, an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">importing.cpp</span></code> for import related stuff.</p></li>

will make it a separate posting to cite these.</p></li>
<li><p>Documented the requirements on the compiler more clearly, document
the fact that we require scons and which version of Python (2.6 or
2.7).</p></li>
<li><p>The is now a codespeed implementation up and running with historical
data for up to Nuitka 0.3.8 runs of “PyStone” and with pybench. It

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.8<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-8" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some real
news and a slight performance increase. The significant news is added
“Windows Support”. You can now hope to run Nuitka on Windows too and
have it produce working executables against either the standard Python
distribution or a MinGW compiled Python.</p>
<p>There are still some small things to iron out, and clearly documentation
needs to be created, and esp. the DLL hell problem of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">msvcr90.dll</span></code>
vs. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">msvcrt.dll</span></code>, is not yet fully resolved, but appears to be not as
harmful, at least not on native Windows.</p>
<p>I am thanking Khalid Abu Bakr for making this possible. I was surprised
to see this happen. I clearly didn’t make it easy. He found a good way
around <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucontext</span></code>, identifier clashes, and a very tricky symbol
problems where the CPython library under Windows exports less than under
Linux. Thanks a whole lot.</p>
<p>Currently the Windows support is considered experimental and works with
MinGW 4.5 or higher only.</p>
<p>Otherwise there have been the usual round of performance improvements
and more cleanups. This release is otherwise milestone 2 work only,
which will have to continue for some time more.</p>

<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id496" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lambda generators were not fully compatible, their simple form could
yield an extra value. The behavior for Python 2.6 and 2.7 is also
different and Nuitka now mimics both correctly, depending on the used
Python version</p></li>
<li><p>The given parameter count cited in the error message in case of too
many parameters, didn’t include the given keyword parameters in the
error message.</p></li>
<li><p>There was an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assert</span> <span class="pre">False</span></code> right after warning about not found

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id497">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id497" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>When unpacking variables in assignments, the temporary variables are
now held in a new temporary class that is designed for the task
specifically.</p>
<p>This avoids the taking of a reference just because the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObjectTemporary</span></code> destructor insisted on releasing one. The new
class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObjectTempHolder</span></code> hands the existing reference over and
releases only in case of exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When unpacking variable in for loops, the value from the iterator may
be directly assigned, if it’s to a variable.</p>
<p>In general this would be possible for every assignment target that
cannot raise, but the infrastructure cannot tell yet, which these
would be. This will improve with more milestone 3 work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Branches with only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pass</span></code> inside are removed, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pass</span></code> statements
are removed before the code generation stage. This makes it easier to
achieve and decide empty branches.</p></li>
<li><p>There is now a global variable class per module. It appears that it
is indeed faster to roll out a class per module accessing the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">module</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> rather than having one class and use a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">module</span> <span class="pre">**</span></code>,
which is quite disappointing from the C++ compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Also <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAKE_LIST</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAKE_TUPLE</span></code> have gained special cases for
the 0 arguments case. Even when the size of the variadic template
parameters should be known to the compiler, it seems, it wasn’t
eliminating the branch, so this was a speedup measured with valgrind.</p></li>
<li><p>Empty tried branches are now replaced when possible with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">except</span></code> statements, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> is simplified in
this case. This gives a cleaner tree structure and less verbose C++
code which the compiler threw away, but was strange to have in the
first place.</p></li>
<li><p>In conditions the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">or</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">and</span></code> were evaluated with Python
objects instead of with C++ bool, which was unnecessary overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>List contractions got more clever in how they assign from the
iterator value.</p>
<p>It now uses a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObjectTemporary</span></code> if it’s assigned to multiple
values, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObjectTempHolder</span></code> if it’s only assigned once, to
something that could raise, or a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObject</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> if an exception
cannot be raised. This avoids temporary references completely for the
common case.</p>

<h3>New Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id499" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The CPython 2.7 test suite now also has the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doctests</span></code> extracted to
static tests, which improves test coverage for Nuitka again.</p>
<p>This was previously only done for CPython 2.6 test suite, but the
test suites are different enough to make this useful, e.g. to
discover newly changed behavior like with the lambda generators.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added Shed Skin 0.7.1 examples as benchmarks, so we can start to
compare Nuitka performance in these tests. These will be the focus of
numbers for the 0.4.x release series.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a micro benchmark to check unpacking behavior. Some of these
are needed to prove that a change is an actual improvement, when its
effect can go under in noise of in-line vs. no in-line behavior of
the C++ compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Added “pybench” benchmark which reveals that Nuitka is for some
things much faster, but there are still fields to work on. This
version needed changes to stand the speed of Nuitka. These will be
subject of a later posting.</p></li>

<p>This is about the new release with focus on performance and cleanups. It
indicates significant progress with the milestone this release series
really is about as it adds a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compiled_method</span></code> type.</p>
<p>So far functions, generator function, generator expressions were
compiled objects, but in the context of classes, functions were wrapped
in CPython <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">instancemethod</span></code> objects. The new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compiled_method</span></code> is
specifically designed for wrapping <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compiled_function</span></code> and therefore
more efficient at it.</p>

exit code in case of “file not found” was not the same as CPython. It
should be 2, not 1.</p></li>
<li><p>The exit code of the created programs (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code> mode) in case of an
uncaught exception was 0, now it an error exit with value 1, like
CPython does it.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id503" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Global variable assignments now also use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assign0</span></code> where no
reference exists.</p>
<p>The assignment code for module variables is actually faster if it
needs not drop the reference, but clearly the code shouldn’t bother
to take it on the outside just for that. This variant existed, but
wasn’t used as much so far.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The instance method objects are now Nuitka’s own compiled type too.
This should make things slightly faster by itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Our new compiled method objects support dedicated method parsing
code, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">self</span></code> is passed directly, allowing to make calls
taking a fast path in parameter parsing.</p>
<p>This avoids allocating/freeing a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code> object per method call,
while reduced 3% ticks in “PyStone” benchmark, so that’s significant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Solved a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUILTIN_RANGE</span></code> to change it to pre-allocating
the list in the final size as we normally do everywhere else. This
was a tick reduction of 0.4% in “PyStone” benchmark, but the
measurement method normalizes on loop speed, so it’s not visible in
the numbers output.</p></li>
<li><p>Parameter variables cannot possibly be uninitialized at creation and
most often they are never subject to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">del</span></code> statement. Adding
dedicated C++ variable classes gave a big speedup, around 3% of
“PyStone” benchmark ticks.</p></li>
<li><p>Some abstract object operations were re-implemented, which allows to
avoid function calls e.g. in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ITERATOR_NEXT</span></code> case, this gave a
few percent on “PyStone” as well.</p></li>

<li><p>Inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka.codegen</span></code> package the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MainControl</span></code> module now
longer reaches into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Generator</span></code> for simple things, but goes through
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeGeneration</span></code> for everything now.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Generator</span></code> module uses almost no tree nodes anymore, but
instead gets information passed in function calls. This allows for a
cleanup of the interface towards <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeGeneration</span></code>. Gives a cleaner
view on the C++ code generation, and generally furthers the goal of
other than C++ language backends.</p></li>
<li><p>More “PyLint” work, many of the reported warnings have been
addressed, but it’s not yet happy.</p></li>
<li><p>Defaults for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yield</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code> and these values
are now already added (as constants) during tree building so that no
such special cases need to be dealt with in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeGeneration</span></code> and

<li><p>Parameter parsing code has been unified even further, now the whole
entry point is generated by one of the function in the new

<p>This is a 132% speed of 0.3.7 compared to CPython, up from 109% compare
to the previous release. This is a another small increase, that can be
fully attributed to milestone 2 measures, i.e. not analysis, but purely
more efficient C++ code generation and the new compiled method type.</p>
<p>One can now safely assume that it is at least twice as fast, but I will
try and get the PyPy or Shedskin test suite to run as benchmarks to
prove it.</p>
<p>No milestone 3 work in this release. I believe it’s best to finish with
milestone 2 first, because these are quite universal gains that we
should have covered.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.6<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-6" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The major point this for this release is cleanup work, and generally bug
fixes, esp. in the field of importing. This release cleans up many small
open ends of Nuitka, closing quite a bunch of consistency <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code>
items, and then aims at cleaner structures internally, so optimization
analysis shall become “easy”. It is a correctness and framework release,

<li><p>Absolute and relative imports were e.g. both tried all the time, now
if you specify absolute or relative imports, it will be attempted in
the same way than CPython does. This can make a difference with
compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions with a “locals dict” (using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals</span></code> built-in or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code>
statement) were not 100% compatible in the way the locals dictionary
was updated, this got fixed. It seems that directly updating a dict
is not what CPython does at all, instead it only pushes things to the
dictionary, when it believes it has to. Nuitka now does the same
thing, making it faster and more compatible at the same time with
these kind of corner cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Nested packages didn’t work, they do now. Nuitka itself is now
successfully using nested packages (e.g.

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.5<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-5" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This new release of Nuitka is an overall improvement on many fronts,
there is no real focus this time, likely due to the long time it was in
the making.</p>
<p>The major points are more optimization work, largely enhanced import
handling and another improvement on the performance side. But there are
also many bug fixes, more test coverage, usability and compatibility.</p>
<p>Something esp. noteworthy to me and valued is that many important
changes were performed or at least triggered by Nicolas Dumazet, who
contributed a lot of high quality commits as you can see from the gitweb
history. He appears to try and compile Mercurial and Nuitka, and this
resulted in important contributions.</p>
<div class="section" id="id515">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id515" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nicolas found a reference counting bug with nested parameter calls.
Where a function had parameters of the form <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a,</span> <span class="pre">(b,c)</span></code> it could
crash. This got fixed and covered with a reference count test.</p></li>
<li><p>Another reference count problem when accessing the locals dictionary
was corrected.</p></li>
<li><p>Values <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.0</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-0.0</span></code> were treated as the same. They are not
though, they have a different sign that should not get lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Nested contractions didn’t work correctly, when the contraction was
to iterate over another contraction which needs a closure. The
problem was addressing by splitting the building of a contraction
from the body of the contraction, so that these are now 2 nodes,
making it easy for the closure handling to get things right.</p></li>
<li><p>Global statements in function with local <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec()</span></code> would still use
the value from the locals dictionary. Nuitka is now compatible to
CPython with this too.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas fixed problems with modules of the same name inside different
packages. We now use the full name including parent package names for
code generation and look-ups.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__module__</span></code> attribute of classes was only set after the class
was created. Now it is already available in the class body.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__doc__</span></code> attribute of classes was not set at all. Now it is.</p></li>
<li><p>The relative import inside nested packages now works correctly. With
Nicolas moving all of Nuitka to a package, the compile itself exposed
many weaknesses.</p></li>

attached but the re-raise statement line.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Modules and packages have been unified. Packages can now also have
code in “__init__.py” and then it will be executed when the package
is imported.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas added the ability to create deep output directory structures
without having to create them beforehand. This makes
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--output-dir=some/deep/path</span></code> usable.</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel build by Scons was added as an option and enabled by
default, which enhances scalability for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code> compilations a
lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas enhanced the CPU count detection used for the parallel build.
Turned out that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multithreading.cpu_count()</span></code> doesn’t give us the
number of available cores, so he contributed code to determine that.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for upcoming g++ 4.6 has been added. The use of the new
option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--lto</span></code> has been been prepared, but right now it appears
that the C++ compiler will need more fixes, before we can this
feature with Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--display-tree</span></code> feature got an overhaul and now displays the
node tree along with the source code. It puts the cursor on the line
of the node you selected. Unfortunately I cannot get it to work
two-way yet. I will ask for help with this in a separate posting as
we can really use a “python-qt” expert it seems.</p></li>
<li><p>Added meaningful error messages in the “file not found” case.
Previously I just didn’t care, but we sort of approach end user
usability with this.</p></li>

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id517" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added optimization for the built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">range()</span></code> which otherwise
requires a module and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">builtin</span></code> module lookup, then parameter
parsing. Now this is much faster with Nuitka and small ranges (less
than 256 values) are converted to constants directly, avoiding run
time overhead entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>Code for re-raise statements now use a simple re-throw of the
exception where possible, and only do the hard work where the
re-throw is not inside an exception handler.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant folding of operations and comparisons is now performed if
the operands are constants.</p></li>
<li><p>Values of some built-ins are pre-computed if the operands are
constants.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of module attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code> is replaced by a constant

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id518" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Nicolas moved the Nuitka source code to its own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nuitka</span></code> package.
That is going to make packaging it a lot easier and allows cleaner
code.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas introduced a fast path in the tree building which often
delegates (or should do that) to a function. This reduced a lot of
the dispatching code and highlights more clearly where such is
missing right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Together we worked on the line length issues of Nuitka. We agreed on
a style and very long lines will vanish from Nuitka with time. Thanks
for pushing me there.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas also did provide many style fixes and general improvements,
e.g. using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObjectTemporary</span></code> in more places in the C++ code, or
not using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.find</span></code> where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code> is a better choice.</p></li>
<li><p>The node structure got cleaned up towards the direction that
assignments always have an assignment as a child.</p>
<p>A function definition, or a class definition, are effectively
assignments, and in order to not have to treat this as special cases
everywhere, they need to have assignment targets as child nodes.</p>
<p>Without such changes, optimization will have to take too many things
into account. This is not yet completed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nicolas merged some node tree building functions that previously
handled deletion and assigning differently, giving us better code
reuse.</p></li>
<li><p>The constants code generation was moved to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__constants.cpp</span></code>
where it doesn’t make __main__.cpp so much harder to read anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>The module declarations have been moved to their own header files.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas cleaned up the scripts used to test Nuitka big time, removing
repetitive code and improving the logic. Very much appreciated.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas also documented a things in the Nuitka source code or got me
to document things that looked strange, but have reasons behind it.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas solved the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> related to built-in module accesses.
These will now be way faster than before.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicolas also solved the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TODO</span></code> related to the performance of
“locals dict” variable accesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Generator.py no longer contains classes. The Contexts objects are
supposed to contain the state, and as such the generator objects
never made much sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Also with the help of Scons community, I figured out how to avoid
having object files inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src</span></code> directory of Nuitka. That
should also help packaging, now all build products go to the .build
directory as they should.</p></li>
<li><p>The vertical white space of the generated C++ got a few cleanups,
trailing/leading new line is more consistent now, and there were some
assertions added that it doesn’t happen.</p></li>

<h3>New Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id519" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The CPython 2.6 tests are now also run by CPython 2.7 and the other
way around and need to report the same test failure reports, which
found a couple of issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the test suite is run with and without <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--debug</span></code> mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Basic tests got extended to cover more topics and catch more issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Program tests got extended to cover code in packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Added more exec scope tests. Currently inlining of exec statements is
disabled though, because it requires entirely different rules to be
done right, it has been pushed back to the next release.</p></li>

<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id520" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">g++-nuitka</span></code> script is no more. With the help of the Scons
community, this is now performed inside the scons and only once
instead of each time for every C++ file.</p></li>
<li><p>When using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--debug</span></code>, the generated C++ is compiled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-Wall</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-Werror</span></code> so that some form of bugs in the generated C++ code
will be detected immediately. This found a few issues already.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a new git merge policy in place. Basically it says, that if
you submit me a pull request, that I will deal with it before
publishing anything new, so you can rely on the current git to
provide you a good base to work on. I am doing more frequent
pre-releases already and I would like to merge from your git.</p></li>
<li><p>The “README.txt” was updated to reflect current optimization status
and plans. There is still a lot to do before constant propagation can
work, but this explains things a bit better now. I hope to expand
this more and more with time.</p></li>
<li><p>There is now a “misc/clean-up.sh” script that prints the commands to
erase all the temporary files sticking around in the source tree.</p>
<p>That is for you if you like me, have other directories inside,
ignored, that you don’t want to delete.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then there is now a script that prints all source filenames, so you
can more easily open them all in your editor.</p></li>
<li><p>And very important, there is now a “check-release.sh” script that
performs all the tests I think should be done before making a
release.</p></li>
<li><p>Pylint got more happy with the current Nuitka source. In some places,
I added comments where rules should be granted exceptions.</p></li>

<p>This is 109% for 0.3.5, up from 91% before.</p>
<p>Overall this release is primarily an improvement in the domain of

The optimization framework only makes a first showing of with the
framework to organize them. There is still work to do to migrate
optimization previously present</p>
<p>It will take more time before we will see effect from these. I believe
that even more cleanups of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TreeBuilding</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Nodes</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CodeGeneration</span></code> will be required, before everything is in place for
the big jump in performance numbers. But still, passing 100% feels good.
Time to rejoice.</p>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.4<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-4" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This new release of Nuitka has a focus on re-organizing the Nuitka
generated source code and a modest improvement on the performance side.</p>
<p>For a long time now, Nuitka has generated a single C++ file and asked
the C++ compiler to translate it to an executable or shared library for
CPython to load. This was done even when embedding many modules into one
(the “deep” compilation mode, option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code>).</p>
<p>This was simple to do and in theory ought to allow the compiler to do
the most optimization. But for large programs, the resulting source code
could have exponential compile time behavior in the C++ compiler. At
least for the GNU g++ this was the case, others probably as well. This
is of course at the end a scalability issue of Nuitka, which now has
been addressed.</p>
<p>So the major advancement of this release is to make the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code>
option useful. But also there have been a performance improvements,
which end up giving us another boost for the “PyStone” benchmark.</p>
<div class="section" id="id522">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id522" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Imports of modules local to packages now work correctly, closing the
small compatibility gap that was there.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules with a “-” in their name are allowed in CPython through
dynamic imports. This lead to wrong C++ code created. (Thanks to Li
Xuan Ji for reporting and submitting a patch to fix it.)</p></li>
<li><p>There were warnings about wrong format used for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ssize_t</span></code> type of
CPython. (Again, thanks to Li Xuan Ji for reporting and submitting
the patch to fix it.)</p></li>
<li><p>When a wrong exception type is raised, the traceback should still be
the one of the original one.</p></li>
<li><p>Set and dict contractions (Python 2.7 features) declared local
variables for global variables used. This went unnoticed, because
list contractions don’t generate code for local variables at all, as
they cannot have such.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type()</span></code> built-in to create a new class could attribute
it to the wrong module, this is now corrected.</p></li>

<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id523" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

<li><p>Uses Scons to execute the actual C++ build, giving some immediate

<li><p>Now caches build results and Scons will only rebuild as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>The direct use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__import__()</span></code> with a constant module name as
parameter is also followed in “deep” mode. With time, non-constants
may still become predictable, right now it must be a real CPython

<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id524" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>

require a module and built-in module lookup, then parameter parsing.
Now these are really quick with Nuitka.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type()</span></code> built-in with one parameter. As
above, using from builtin module can be very slow. Now it is
instantaneous.</p></li>
<li><p>Added optimization for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">type()</span></code> built-in with three parameters.
It’s rarely used, but providing our own variant, allowed to fix the

<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id525" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using scons is a big cleanup for the way how C++ compiler related
options are applied. It also makes it easier to re-build without
Nuitka, e.g. if you were using Nuitka in your packages, you can
easily build in the same way than Nuitka does.</p></li>
<li><p>Static helpers source code has been moved to “.hpp” and “.cpp” files,
instead of being in “.py” files. This makes C++ compiler messages
more readable and allows us to use C++ mode in Emacs etc., making it
easier to write things.</p></li>
<li><p>Generated code for each module ends up in a separate file per module
or package.</p></li>
<li><p>Constants etc. go to their own file (although not named sensible yet,
likely going to change too)</p></li>
<li><p>Module variables are now created by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CPythonModule</span></code> node only
and are unique, this is to make optimization of these feasible. This
is a pre-step to module variable optimization.</p></li>

thing, but you know there is always more, e.g. Python 2.7.</p>
<p>With the addition of set contractions and dict contractions in this very
release, Nuitka is approaching Python support for 2.7, and then there
are some bug fixes.</p>
<div class="section" id="id537">
<h3>Bug fixes<a class="headerlink" href="#id537" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Calling a function with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code> and using a non-dict for it was
leading to wrong behavior.</p>
<p>Now a mapping is good enough as input for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code> parameter and
it’s checked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deeply nested packages “package.subpackage.module” were not found and
gave a warning from Nuitka, with the consequence that they were not
embedded in the executable. They now are.</p></li>
<li><p>Some error messages for wrong parameters didn’t match literally. For
example “function got multiple…” as opposed to “function() got
multiple…” and alike.</p></li>
<li><p>Files that ended in line with a “#” but without a new line gave an
error from “ast.parse”. As a workaround, a new line is added to the
end of the file if it’s “missing”.</p></li>
<li><p>More correct exception locations for complex code lines. I noted that
the current line indication should not only be restored when the call
at hand failed, but in any case. Otherwise sometimes the exception
stack would not be correct. It now is - more often. Right now, this
has no systematic test.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-raised exceptions didn’t appear on the stack if caught inside the
same function, these are now correct.</p></li>
<li><p>For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> the globals argument needs to have “__builtins__” added,
but the check was performed with the mapping interface.</p>
<p>That is not how CPython does it, and so e.g. the mapping could use a
default value for “__builtins__” which could lead to incorrect
behavior. Clearly a corner case, but one that works fully compatible
now.</p>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="id538">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id538" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The local and shared local variable C++ classes have a flag
“free_value” to indicate if an “PY_DECREF” needs to be done when
releasing the object. But still the code used “Py_XDECREF” (which
allows for “NULL” values to be ignored.) when the releasing of the
object was done. Now the inconsistency of using “NULL” as “object”
value with “free_value” set to true was removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuple constants were copied before using them without a point. They
are immutable anyway.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="id539">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id539" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Improved more of the indentation of the generated C++ which was not
very good for contractions so far. Now it is. Also assignments should
be better now.</p></li>
<li><p>The generation of code for contractions was made more general and
templates split into multiple parts. This enabled reuse of the code
for list contractions in dictionary and set contractions.</p></li>
<li><p>The with statement has its own template now and got cleaned up
regarding indentation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id540">
<h3>New Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#id540" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There is now a script to extract the “doctests” from the CPython test
suite and it generates Python source code from them. This can be
compiled with Nuitka and output compared to CPython. Without this,
the doctest parts of the CPython test suite is mostly useless.
Solving this improved test coverage, leading to many small fixes. I
will dedicate a later posting to the tool, maybe it is useful in
other contexts as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference count tests have been expanded to cover assignment to
multiple assignment targets, and to attributes.</p></li>
<li><p>The deep program test case, now also have a module in a sub-package
to cover this case as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id541">
<h3>Organisational<a class="headerlink" href="#id541" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://nuitka.net/gitweb">gitweb interface</a> (since disabled)
might be considered an alternative to downloading the source if you
want to provide a pointer, or want to take a quick glance at the
source code. You can already download with git, follow the link below
to the page explaining it.</p></li>
<li><p>The “README.txt” has documented more of the differences and I
consequently updated the Differences page. There is now a distinction
between generally missing functionality and things that don’t work in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code> mode, where Nuitka is supposed to create one executable.</p>
<p>I will make it a priority to remove the (minor) issues of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--deep</span></code>
mode in the next release, as this is only relatively little work, and
not a good difference to have. We want these to be empty, right? But
for the time being, I document the known differences there.</p>

<p>This is 66% for 0.3.2, slightly up from the 58% of 0.3.1 before. The

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.1<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-1" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance and contains
only cleanups and optimization. Most go into the direction of more
readable code, some aim at making the basic things faster, with good
results as to performance as you can see below.</p>
<div class="section" id="id543">
<h3>Optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#id543" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Constants in conditions of conditional expressions (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">cond</span> <span class="pre">else</span>
<span class="pre">d</span></code>), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elif</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> are now evaluated to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">true</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">false</span></code> directly. Before there would be temporary python object
created from it which was then checked if it had a truth value.</p>
<p>All of that is obviously overhead only. And it hurts the typically
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span> <span class="pre">1:</span></code> infinite loop case badly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not generate code to catch <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BreakException</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ContinueException</span></code> unless a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> statement
being in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try:</span> <span class="pre">finally:</span></code> block inside that loop actually require
this.</p>
<p>Even while uncaught exceptions are cheap, it is still an improvement
worthwhile and it clearly improves the readability for the normal
case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The compiler more aggressively prepares tuples, lists and dicts from
the source code as constants if their contents is “immutable” instead
of building at run time. An example of a “mutable” tuple would be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">({},)</span></code> which is not safe to share, and therefore will still be
built at run time.</p>
<p>For dictionaries and lists, copies will be made, under the assumption
that copying a dictionary will always be faster, than making it from
scratch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The parameter parsing code was dynamically building the tuple of
argument names to check if an argument name was allowed by checking
the equivalent of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">argument_names</span></code>. This was of course
wasteful and now a pre-built constant is used for this, so it should
be much faster to call functions with keyword arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>There are new templates files and also actual templates now for the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loop code generation. And I started work on
having a template for assignments.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id544">
<h3>Cleanups<a class="headerlink" href="#id544" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Do not generate code for the else of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops if
there is no such branch. This uncluttered the generated code
somewhat.</p></li>
<li><p>The indentation of the generated C++ was not very good and whitespace
was often trailing, or e.g. a real tab was used instead of “t”. Some
things didn’t play well together here.</p>
<p>Now much of the generated C++ code is much more readable and white
space cleaner. For optimization to be done, the humans need to be
able to read the generated code too. Mind you, the aim is not to
produce usable C++, but on the other hand, it must be possible to
understand it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To the same end of readability, the empty <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">else</span> <span class="pre">{}</span></code> branches are
avoided for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops. While the C++
compiler can be expected to remove these, they seriously cluttered up
things.</p></li>
<li><p>The constant management code in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Context</span></code> was largely simplified.
Now the code is using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Constant</span></code> class to find its way around
the problem that dicts, sets, etc. are not hashable, or that
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">complex</span></code> is not being ordered; this was necessary to allow deeply
nested constants, but it is also a simpler code now.</p></li>
<li><p>The C++ code generated for functions now has two entry points, one
for Python calls (arguments as a list and dictionary for parsing) and
one where this has happened successfully. In the future this should
allow for faster function calls avoiding the building of argument
tuples and dictionaries all-together.</p></li>
<li><p>For every function there was a “traceback adder” which was only used
in the C++ exception handling before exit to CPython to add to the
traceback object. This was now in-lined, as it won’t be shared ever.</p></li>

<h2>Nuitka Release 0.3.0<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-3-0" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This release 0.3.0 is the first release to focus on performance. In the
0.2.x series Nuitka achieved feature parity with CPython 2.6 and that
was very important, but now it is time to make it really useful.</p>
<p>Optimization has been one of the main points, although I was also a bit
forward looking to Python 2.7 language constructs. This release is the
first where I really started to measure things and removed the most
important bottlenecks.</p>
<div class="section" id="id546">
<h3>New Features<a class="headerlink" href="#id546" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Added option to control <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--debug</span></code>. With this option the C++ debug
information is present in the file, otherwise it is not. This will
give much smaller “.so” and “.exe” files than before.</p></li>
<li><p>Added option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-optimization</span></code> to disable all optimization.</p>
<p>It enables C++ asserts and compiles with less aggressive C++ compiler
optimization, so it can be used for debugging purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for Python 2.7 set literals has been added.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance-enhancements">
<h3>Performance Enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-enhancements" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Fast global variables: Reads of global variables were fast already.
This was due to a trick that is now also used to check them and to do
a much quicker update if they are already set.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> statements: To make sure these statements
execute the finally handlers if inside a try, these used C++
exceptions that were caught by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finally</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops.</p>
<p>This was very slow and had very bad performance. Now it is checked if
this is at all necessary and then it’s only done for the rare case
where a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> really is inside the tried block.
Otherwise it is now translated to a C++ <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> which
the C++ compiler handles more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unlikely()</span></code> compiler hints to all errors handling cases to
allow the C++ compiler to generate more efficient branch code.</p></li>
<li><p>The for loop code was using an exception handler to make sure the
iterated value was released, using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PyObjectTemporary</span></code> for that
instead now, which should lead to better generated code.</p></li>
<li><p>Using constant dictionaries and copy from them instead of building
them at run time even when contents was constant.</p></li>

from any optimization, so as to not be premature.</p>
<p>From now on speed optimization is going to be the focus though. Because

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id560" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Overall, the amount of differences between CPython and Nuitka is heading
towards zero. Also most of the improvements done in this release were
very straightforward cleanups and not much work was required, mostly
things are about cleanups and then it becomes easily right. The new type
for the compiled generator expressions was simple to create, esp. as I
could check what CPython does in its source code.</p>
<p>For optimization purposes, I decided that generator expressions and
generator functions will be separate compiled types, as most of their
behavior will not be shared. I believe optimizing generator expressions
to run well is an important enough goal to warrant that they have their
own implementation. Now that this is done, I will repeat it with
generator functions.</p>
<p>Generator functions already work quite fine, but like generator
expressions did before this release, they can leak references if not
finished , and they don’t have the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">throw()</span></code> method, which seems very
important to the correct operation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contextlib</span></code>. So I will
introduce a decicated type for these too, possibly in the next release.</p>

using increasingly less code from CPython. Now it’s nothing at all
anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>This lead to major cleanup of run time compiled function creation

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id564" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The major difference now is the lack of a throw method for generator
functions. I will try to address that in a 0.2.2 release if possible.
The plan is that the 0.2.x series will complete these tasks, and 0.3
could aim at some basic optimization finally.</p>

<li><p>Migrated the Python parser from the deprecated and problematic

<span class="pre">b</span></code> parser problem. A pity it was not available at the time I
started, but the migration was relatively painless now.</p></li>
<li><p>I found and fixed wrong encoding of binary data into C++ literals.
Now Nuitka uses C++0x raw strings, and these problems are gone.</p></li>
<li><p>The decoding of constants was done with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">marshal</span></code> module, but
that appears to not deeply care enough about unicode encoding it
seems. Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cPickle</span></code> now, which seems less efficient, but is more
correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Another difference is gone: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> inside

<li><p>Inlining of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> statements with constant expressions. These are
now compiled at compile time, not at run time anymore. I observed
that an increasing number of CPython tests use exec to do things in

more effective. I intend to do the same with eval expressions too,
probably in a minor release.</p></li>

<h3>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#id569" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>So give it a whirl. I consider it to be substantially better than
before, and the list of differences to CPython is getting small enough,
plus there is already a fair bit of polish to it. Just watch out that it
needs gcc-4.5 or higher now.</p>

<div class="section" id="nuitka-release-0-1-1">
<h2>Nuitka Release 0.1.1<a class="headerlink" href="#nuitka-release-0-1-1" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>I just have just updated Nuitka to version 0.1.1 which is a bug fix
release to 0.1, which corrects many of the small things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Updated the CPython test suite to 2.6.6rc and minimized much of
existing differences in the course.</p></li>
<li><p>Compiles standalone executable that includes modules (with –deep
option), but packages are not yet included successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference leaks with exceptions are no more.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.exc_info()</span></code> works now mostly as expected (it’s not a stack of
exceptions).</p></li>
<li><p>More readable generated code, better organisation of C++ template
code.</p></li>
<li><p>Restored debug option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--g++-only</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest thing probably is the progress with exception tracebacks
objects in exception handlers, which were not there before (always
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>). Having these in place will make it much more compatible. Also
with manually raised exceptions and assertions, tracebacks will now be
more correct to the line.</p>
<p>On a bad news, I discovered that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compiler</span></code> module that I use to
create the AST from Python source code, is not only deprecated, but also
broken. I created the <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue9656">CPython bug</a>
about it, basically it cannot distinguish some code of the form <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d[1,]</span>
<span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">None</span></code> from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d[1]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">None</span></code>. This will require a migration of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ast</span></code> module, which should not be too challenging, but will take some
time.</p>
<p>I am aiming at it for a 0.2 release. Generating wrong code (Nuitka sees
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">d[1]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">None</span></code> in both cases) is a show blocker and needs a solution.</p>
<p>So, yeah. It’s better, it’s there, but still experimental. You will find
its latest version here. Please try it out and let me know what you
think in the comments section.</p>
