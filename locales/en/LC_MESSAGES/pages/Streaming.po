"The Nuitka development will hopefully become richer by me developing "
"online one day per week. Maybe more or less often, but I believe on a "
"regular basis will be best."

"On Discord, we will have a Streaming room. There is a react bot, that you"
" can use to be automatically notified by Discord, when a Stream is "
"started, this one is in: https://discord.gg/nZ9hr9tUck the welcome "
"channel of the Discord."

"The main chat on Gitter will be linked a chat room on Discord, so for "
"people not on Discord, they still have that available."

"The stream will be recorded in Youtube and later put online, maybe only a"
" few excerpts, not sure how good it's going to be. There will be quality "
"issues in the beginning. And I don't want to spend a lot of time editing "
"material that might not get watched at all."

"Discord will be used for a call-in part. I will unmute people and discuss"
" one on one with viewers, live on air, answering questions."

"And then, I have setup OBS with a camera view and my desktop shared, and "
"I expect to be streaming to Youtube on my existing channel that I cleaned"
" up a bit: https://www.youtube.com/c/KayHayen"

"I believe the weekend should be used. Not sure yet when exactly I can "
"start, I am aiming for mid January right now, with a test stream before "

"I plan to stream with one lunch/sports break, on my CEST morning and an "
"afternoon or evening time, and maybe if I get carried away, more often."

"My idea is to take on challenging topics, e.g. making code specialization"
" of ``INT`` ``LONG`` and ``CLONG`` work for code like ``some_int += 2``, "
"where the ``2`` is currently used as a prepared ``INT`` or ``LONG`` "
"object (depending on Python version)."

"In a test stream, it worked really well to commonly improve the web site."
" Documentation and generally clarification would be good, but I think "
"there also needs to be some plan, like making a certain piece of code "
"quicker. I will be asking for submissions on Twitter and/or in a blog "
"post."

"I think I could e.g. go with streaming on Sunday and announcing the topic"
" on Friday in a blog post, and/or a Twitter post. Then when going live, a"
" Discord ping is done. Gitter chat will also get a text message. Youtube "
"has the bell, that I might ask people to use, but I don't like asking "
"these things."
