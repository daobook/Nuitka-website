"Dateutil standalone test have already been covered. Manual testing is now"
" done to compare the pytest results of a nuitka wheel built using "
"``python setup.py bdist_nuitka`` to the regular pytest of the dateutil "
"package. Testing is done to ensure that nuitka is building the wheel "
"correctly. If the pytests pass/fail in the same way, that means Nuitka "
"built the wheel properly. Else if the tests differ, then something is "
"wrong. Virtualenv is used to create a clean environment with no outside "
"pollution."
