"For example, in the new feature branch, a couple of boring things are "
"happening. Support for frame stack will reduce the diff, as will some "
"work to match CPython's choices for exception line numbers. Completing "
"will take a while, but should not block a release. So this is best done "
"in the feature branch, esp. as nothing is going to really depend on it."
