"my new vServer is now online, the old site blog redirects to it now, and "
"planets follow the new site already. The old site is redirecting with 301"
" error code for some more time, hopefully this will be good enough of a "
"migration. It felt smooth from here, clearly, and the new site is much "
"faster of course, because it's not throttled through my poor DSL "

"I also registered it a domain name `\"nuitka.net\" <https://nuitka.net>`_"
" for it finally. Originally I wanted to give it a DynDNS name, but I "
"already have 2, and the third was supposed to cost money, and I didn't "
"feel like using another service, or cheating them if you consider that an"
" option, so that was it, I bought the domain name. Clearly it will also "
"be easier for people to remember."

"Moving things over was pretty painless. The Wordpress software has a "
"pretty good export feature, which only didn't manage the custom menu and "
"appearance settings. But I guess it's about content anyway, so probably "
"some way that would work too, but it was easy enough to reproduce that by"
" hand. I appreciate Wordpress even more now."

"Also I did some tuning of the system, to use less memory. Only 512M are "
"available, and so I run less Apache processes for less requests (memory "
"leaks), disabled IPv6 (yes, hate me for it), reduced amounts of gettys, "
"and so on. Nothing I am not familiar with, the ARM machine had 512M as "
"well, and to me no reason to use the bigger package just because of that."

"The main difference is the faster CPU, I seem to get 3Ghz Intel now, "

"Only downside is that I currently haven't got the `\"speedcenter\" "
"<https://speedcenter.nuitka.net>`_ up and running again. After losing my "
"hardware, the old data cannot be compared with new one, and then it "
"doesn't feel like a priority right now. I seem to be working instead on "
"XML based regression tests of the optimizer: The output of \"--dump-xml\""
" should be compared for a large quantity of files, to discover "
"regressions of the optimizer as soon as possible, this will enable me to "
"make changes and not have to review the C++ as much, to find out if "
"something is compiled correctly. This way I should detect it when known "
"good cases degrade, and generally to demonstrate better, what actually "
"did improve."
