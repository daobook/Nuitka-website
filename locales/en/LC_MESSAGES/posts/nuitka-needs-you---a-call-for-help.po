"my Python compiler Nuitka has come a long way, and currently I have "
"little to no time to spend on it, due to day job reasons, so it's going "
"to mostly stagnate for about 2 weeks from my side. But that's coming to "
"an end, and still I would like to expand what we currently have, with "
"your help."

"As you will see, covering all the CPython 2.6 and 2.7 language features "

"going ahead, I want to secure that base. And this is where there are "
"several domains where you can help:"

"I did some early testing. The C/API changed in many ways, and my current "
"working state has a couple of fixes for it. I would like somebody else to"
" devote some time to fixing this up. Please contact me if you can help "
"here, esp. if you are competent in the C/API changes of Python 3.1. Even "
"if the CPython 3.1 doesn't matter as much to me, I believe the extended "
"coverage from the new tests in its test suite would be useful. The "
"improved state is not yet released. I would make an release to the "
"person(s) that want to work on it."

"I have started to extract the doctests from the CPython 2.6 test suite. "
"There is a script that does it, and you basically only need to expand it "
"with more of the same. No big issue there, but it could find issues with "
"Nuitka that we would like to know. Of course, it should also be expanded "
"to CPython 2.7 test suite and ultimately also CPython 3.1"

"I noted some issues with the stacks when developing with the CPython 2.7 "
"tests, or now failing 2.6 tests, after some merge work. But what would be"
" needed would be tests to cover all the situations, where exceptions "
"could be raised, and stack traces should ideally be identical for all. "
"This is mostly only accuracy work and the CPython test suite is bad at "
"covering it."
