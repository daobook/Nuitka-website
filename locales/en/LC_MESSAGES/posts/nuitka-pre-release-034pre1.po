"This pre-release of Nuitka has a focus on re-organizing the Nuitka "
"generated source code. Please see the page `\"What is Nuitka?\" "

"For a long time, Nuitka has generated a single C++ file, even when "
"embedding many modules into one. And it has always showed that the GNU "
"g++ compiler clearly has exponential compile time behavior when "
"translating these into the executable."

"This is no more the case. So this pre-release is mainly about making the "
"``--deep`` feature useful. Before the release, I may look into "
"optimizations for speed again. Right now time is very short due to day "
"job reasons, so this pre-release is also about allowing people to use the"
" improvements that I have made and get some feedback about it."

"None at all. Although I am sure that there may be regressions on the "
