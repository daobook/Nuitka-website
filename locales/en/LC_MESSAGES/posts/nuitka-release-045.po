"This release incorporates very many bug fixes, most of which were already"
" part of hot fixes, usability improvements, documentation improvements, "
"new logo, simpler Python3 on Windows, warnings for recursion options, and"
" so on. So it's mostly a consolidation release."

msgid ""
"When targeting Python 3.x, Nuitka was using \"python\" to run Scons to "
"run it under Python 2.x, which is not good enough on systems, where that "
"is already Python3. Improved to only do the guessing where necessary "
"(i.e. when using the in-line copy of Scons) and then to prefer "
"\"python2\". Fixed in 0.4.4.1 already."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using Nuitka created binaries inside a \"virtualenv\", created "
"programs would instantly crash. The attempt to load and patch ``inspect``"
" module was not making sure that ``site`` module was already imported, "
"but inside the \"virtualenv\", it cannot be found unless. Fixed in "
"0.4.4.1 already."

"This release is mostly the result of improvements made based on the surge"
" of users after Europython 2013. Some people went to extents and reported"
" their experience very detailed, and so I could aim at making e.g. their "
"misconceptions about how recursion options work, more obvious through "
"warnings and errors."

"This release is not addressing performance improvements. The next release"
" will be able to focus on that. I am taking my claim of full "
"compatibility very serious, so any time it's broken, it's the highest "
"priority to restore it."
