"This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka "
"<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler, "

"This release breaks interface compatibility, therefore the major version "
"number change. Also \"standalone mode\" has seen significant improvements"
" on both Windows, and Linux. Should work much better now."

msgid ""
"But consider that this part of Nuitka is still in its infancy. As it is "
"not the top priority of mine for Nuitka, which primarily is intended as "
"an super compatible accelerator of Python, it will continue to evolve "
"nearby."

"The \"standalone mode\" was not working on all Redhat, Fedora, and "
"openSUSE platforms and gave warnings with older compilers. Fixed in "
"0.4.7.1 already."

"The \"standalone mode\" was not including all useful encodings. Fixed in "
"0.4.7.2 already."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-050.rst:36
msgid ""
"The \"standalone mode\" was defaulting to ``--python-flag=-S`` which "
"disables the parsing of \"site\" module. That unfortunately made it "
"necessary to reach some modules without modifying ``PYTHONPATH`` which "
"conflicts with the \"out-of-the-box\" experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-050.rst:41

"The \"standalone mode\" is now handling packages properly and generally "
"working on Windows as well."

"The syntax error of having an all catching except clause and then a more "
"specific one wasn't causing a ``SyntaxError`` with Nuitka."

msgid ""
"A corruption bug was identified, when re-raising exceptions, the top "
"entry of the traceback was modified after usage. Depending on ``malloc`` "
"this was potentially causing an endless loop when using it for output."

"When iterating over ``list``, ``set``, this is now automatically lowered "

msgid "So the following code is now equivalent:"

"For constants, this is even more effective, because for mutable "

"Python2: The iteration of large ``range`` is now automatically lowered to"

"The statement only expression optimization got generalized and now is "
"capable of removing useless parts of operations, not only the whole thing"
" when it has not side effects."
msgstr ""

msgid "This works for all container types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-050.rst:114

"Another example is ``type`` built-in operation with single argument. When"
" the result is not used, it need not be called."

"And another example ``is`` and ``is not`` have no effect of their own as "
"well, therefore:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-050.rst:135
msgid ""
"Added proper handling of conditional expression branches in SSA based "
"optimization. So far these branches were ignored, which only acceptable "
"for temporary variables as created by tree building, but not other "
"variable types. This is preparatory for introducing SSA for local "
"variables."

"The option ``--exe`` is now ignored and creating an executable is the "

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-050.rst:159

"Discontinued the support for cross compilation to Win32. That was too "

msgid ""
"The \"executable by default\" interface change improves on the already "
"high ease of use. The new optimization do not give all that much in terms"
" of numbers, but are all signs of structural improvements, and it is "
"steadily approaching the point, where the really interesting stuff will "
"happen."

"The progress for standalone mode is of course significant. It is still "
"not quite there yet, but it is making quick progress now. This will "
"attract a lot of attention hopefully."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-050.rst:184
msgid ""
"As for optimization, the focus for it has shifted to making exception "
"handlers work optimal by default (publish the exception to "
"``sys.exc_info()`` and create traceback only when necessary) and be based"
" on standard branches. Removing special handling of exception handlers, "
"will be the next big step. This release includes some correctness fixes "
"stemming from that work already."
