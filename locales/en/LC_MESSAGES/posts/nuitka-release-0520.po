"This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka "
"<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler, "
"`\"download now\" </doc/download.html>`_."

"This release is mostly about catching up with issues. Most address "
"standalone problems with special modules, but there are also some general"
" compatibility corrections, as well as important fixes for Python3.5 and "
"coroutines and to improve compatibility with special Python variants like"
" Anaconda under the Windows system."

"Standalone Python3.5: The ``_decimal`` module at least is using a "
"``__name__`` that doesn't match the name at load time, causing programs "
"that use it to crash."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-0520.rst:27
msgid ""
"Compatibility: For Python3.3 the ``__loader__`` attribute is now set in "
"all cases, and it needs to have a ``__module__`` attribute. This makes "
"inspection as done by e.g. ``flask`` working."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-0520.rst:31
msgid ""
"Standalone: Added missing hidden dependencies for ``Tkinter`` module, "
"adding support for this to work properly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-0520.rst:34
msgid ""
"Windows: Detecting the Python DLL and EXE used at compile time and "
"preserving this information use during backend compilation. This should "
"make sure we use the proper ones, and avoids hacks for specific Python "
"variants, enhancing the support for Anaconda, WinPython, and CPython "
"installations."

msgid ""
"Windows: The ``--python-debug`` flag now properly detects if the run time"
" is supporting things and error exits if it's not available. For a "
"CPython3.5 installation, it will switch between debug and non-debug "
"Python binaries and DLLs."

"Standalone: Added plug-in for the ``Pwm`` package to properly combine it "
"into a single file, suitable for distribution."

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-0520.rst:48
msgid ""
"Standalone: Packages from standard library, e.g. ``xml`` now have proper "
"``__path__`` as a list and not as a string value, which breaks code of "
"e.g. PyXML."

"This release focused on expanding plugins. These were then used to "
"enhance the success of standalone compatibility. Eventually this should "
"lead to a finished and documented plug-in API, which will open up the "
"Nuitka core to easier hacks and more user contribution for these topics."
