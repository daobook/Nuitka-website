"This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka "
"<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler, "

"This release is mostly a follow up, resolving points that have become "
"possible to resolve after completing the C-ish evolution of Nuitka. So "
"this is more of a service release."

"Improved mode ``--improved`` now sets error lines more properly than "
"CPython does in many cases."

"The ``-python-flag=-S`` mode now preserves ``PYTHONPATH`` and therefore "

"For standalone mode, using ``--python-flag-S`` is now always possible and"

"Fixed handling of exception tests as side effects. These could be "

"Previously Nuitka only ever used the statement line as the line number "
"for all the expression, even if it spawned multiple lines. Usually "
"nothing important, and often even more correct, but sometimes not. Now "
"the line number is most often the same as CPython in full compatibility "
"mode, or better, see above."

"In Python2, the list contractions used to be re-formulated to be function"
