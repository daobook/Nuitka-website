"Closure taking of global variables in member functions of classes that "

"Massive indentation cleanup of keyword argument calls. We have a rule to "

"The release is mainly the result of consolidation work. While the "
"previous release contained many important enhancements, this is another "
"important step towards full SSA, closing one loop whole (class variables "
"and ``exec`` functions), as well as applying it to local variables, "
"largely extending its use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-056.rst:169
msgid ""
"The amount of cleanups is tremendous, in huge part due to infrastructure "
"problems that prevented release repeatedly. This reduces the "

msgid ""
"More importantly, it would appear that now eliminating local and "
"temporary variables that are not necessary is only a small step away. But"
" as usual, while this may be easy to implement now, it will uncover more "
"bugs in existing code, that we need to address before we continue."
