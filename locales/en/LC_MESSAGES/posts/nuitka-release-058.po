"This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka "
"<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler, "

"This release has mainly a focus on cleanups and compatibility "
"improvements. It also advances standalone support, and a few optimization"
" improvements, but it mostly is a maintenance release, attacking long "
"standing issues."

"It was not always working properly, if there was both a package "
"``Something`` and ``something``, by merit of having files "
"``Something/__init__.py`` and ``something.py``."

"Standalone: The search path was preferring system directories and "
"therefore could have conflicting DLLs."

"Fix, the optimization of ``getattr`` with predictable result was crashing"
" the compilation. This was a regression, fixed in 0.5.7.1 already."

"Compatibility: The name mangling inside classes also needs to be applied "
"to global variables."

msgid ""
"Fix, proving ``clang++`` for ``CXX`` was mistakingly thinking of it as a "
"``g++`` and making version checks on it."

"This should make it more apparent if things outside of the distribution "

" copy the source code along in an upcoming release."

"Added experimental standalone mode support for PyQt5. At least headless "

"The name mangling was handled during code generation only. Moved to tree "

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-058.rst:102
msgid ""
"One is that we finally started to have our own import logic, which has "

"compatibility. The case issues were not fixable with standard library "
"code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-058.rst:107
msgid ""
"The second one is that the ``__file__`` attributes for standalone mode is"
" now no longer pointing to the original install and therefore will expose"
" missing stuff sooner. This will have to be followed up with code to scan"
" for missing \"data\" files later on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/nuitka-release-058.rst:112
msgid ""
"For SSA based optimization, there are cleanups in here, esp. the one "
"removing the name mangling, allowing to remove special code for class "
"variables. This makes the SSA tree more reliable. Hope is that the big "
"step (forward propagation through variables) can be made in one of the "
"next releases."
