"Many of you who turn to my easy to use, highly compatible Python compiler"
" `Nuitka <https://nuitka.net>`__, do this mostly because they seek to "
"solve the deployment problem that Python suffers from."

"Be this, because you want to use a newer Python2.7 on RHEL5 without "
"installing anything at all there. Or because Windows is difficult to "
"tackle otherwise."

"For the longest time, Nuitka had not offered anything in this domain, "
"focusing solely on being an accelerator. Lately, I have taken up the "
"challenge and polished initial solutions submitted by contributors."

"This first showed up in the 0.4.7 release, but turned out relatively "
"weak. While first examples were working on Linux, it was not working at "
"all on Windows (anymore). And basically there was a huge lack of tests."

"Actually I didn't mean for it to be released with that feature, but as "
"parts of it seemed to work, I did so. But truth to be sad, that feature "
"is not nearly as polished in that release as you would like it to."

"In current `development releases </pages/download.html>`__, of what is "
"going to become 0.5.0 really soon now, it's much better already. More "
"things actually work. But it appears, there will be more ground to cover,"
" and this is a lot of stuff to sort out."

"So, this is mostly about asking you two things. Give that development "

"And have patience. I am developing Nuitka as an accelerator on a \"no "
"known bugs\" basis. That means, once I know of a bug, I will fix it. OK, "
"some issues in fact take longer, but then it really is not important at "
"all, but difficult at the time. For standalone mode, I can't do it that "
"way, or I would have to neglect the acceleration parts, which I totally "
"don't want to do."

"Because while you maybe are only interested in a packaging solution, many"
" others would like to have that orders of magnitude speedup that I have "
"been aiming for and that feels near now. This is about making Python a "
"viable language for more uses than it currently is."

"So why do it in the first place. For one, I am hoping that it helps "
"people to not turn away from Python. And second, and more important, I am"
" hoping that by making it more useful, more people will join me. (Oh, and"
" thirdly, it's also a nice puzzle to solve. I seem to enjoy that.)"

"Ultimately both modes will be needed, standalone, and acceleration. And "
"it seems like I am working to provide both. For standalone, more often, "
"than seeking to avoid bugs as far as possible, I am going to rely on your"
" participation."
