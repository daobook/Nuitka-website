"It was the first German PyCON and clearly it was overdue as it was now "
"the merger of many already grown up communities. A huge number of talks "
"over 3 days in 3 parallel tracks, with 3 keynotes, was an outstanding "
"program. And very well run. Strict time management, every detail was well"

"I enjoyed the talks, most often in the technical track, but other tracks "

"The food was great too. I esp. liked the Asian day, but there was also "

"We also talked about Cython and Nuitka, and the common history we had as "

"We discussed my goals, and I think we came to the conclusion that they "

"But that's not going to happen. I think i have a cleaner and better "

"As an example of these things, I would mention function call errors, "

"Another keynote speaker (Paul Everitt) had a part about how Zope, which "

"If there had not been Apache failing, there wouldn't have been Zope, and "
