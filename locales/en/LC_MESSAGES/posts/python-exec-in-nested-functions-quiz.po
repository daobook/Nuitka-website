"The correct answer is that you need to add \"in None, None\" to the exec "
"and you are fine. The exec is now allowed and behaves as expected. You "
"can see it in the locals, \"f\" was indeed added to it, the closure value"
" is correct, and the global still works."

"It seems the \"SyntaxError\" tries to avoid such code, but on the other "
"hand, exec is not forbidden when it has parameters, and those imply "
"defaults when they are None."

"Now, I had this strange realization when implementing the \"exec\" "

"in its next version (due later this week) will be able to handle this "
"type code as well. :-)"
