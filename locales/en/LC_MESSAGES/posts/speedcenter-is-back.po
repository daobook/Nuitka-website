"And I was considering the use of codespeed, and had some data online. But"
" ultimately, it got discontinued. This has 3 reasons:"

"Moved the website to a dedicated machine, which broke the previous "

"For example, I didn't want to have to commit and push, just to let the "
"benchmarks run."

msgid ""
"And I wanted to be able to re-run benchmarks with newer compiler, even "
"newer Python, but old Nuitka. Using g++ 4.6 over g++ 4.5 should not "
"impact the data."

"It turned out to be a nightmare to migrate to newer codespeed versions. I"
" found myself starting from empty database - over and over."

"For example, I would want to collect all PyBench results, but only "
"publish those who are expressive. That seemed difficult to achieve."

"Most of the work was aimed at correctness, and effectively was often "
"degrading performance even if only temporary. Seeing it wouldn't have "

"It checks out Nuitka in all versions in a playground, and then runs "

"I have a database per machine, i.e. a distributed repository, where I "
"collect information. That works for me, and will allow me to compare "
"different kinds of machines."

"The advantage is that I have no risk of data loss anymore, and no issues "
"and difficulty with poor interfaces to replace existing data."

"That allows me to inspect the changes before publishing them. It allows "
"me to play with local commits, branches, with information that will go "
"away. I can then push when I choose to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/posts/speedcenter-is-back.rst:77

"That integrates better with my work flow. It allows me to retro-fit "
"benchmarks results on the machine and to be tool independent."

msgid ""
"In principle, I could publish the data in other forms as well, and I "
"likely will. Making tables of e.g. PyBench results seems like one "
"application. Recently, I have worked with Nikola, and could also imagine "
"to integrate Codespeed graph functionality (which is apparently all I "
"want) to there."
