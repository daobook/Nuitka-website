"I am going to the German Python conference in Leipzip and I am going to "

"Of course it's about Nuitka (see `What is Nuitka? "
"</pages/overview.html>`_ ) and I hope it will get a lot of attendance. I "
"am naturally very happy to have the opportunity to present it finally. I "
"had wanted to visit PyCon EU, but the date was never known, and then my "
"early booking holiday overlapped with it, so it was not an option."

"Now giving this presentation will of course be exciting to me. I gave "
"presentations as part of the day job many times, but this time it's "
"obviously a different. It's also a first chance to meet the others as I "
"never was at a Python conference before, and that will be interesting in "
"itself."

"Presenting Nuitka will of course be easy for me. Now I need to plan what "
"I want to be able to present for a demo. Running a big thing like "
"Mercurial would be nice, but I honestly don't know, if that will even be "
"difficult, or if it will take a lot of work. Also the amount of "
"documentation available for Nuitka should increase as part of this. "
"Designs, etc. could be made into diagrams, so people who want to join "
"will have it easier."
