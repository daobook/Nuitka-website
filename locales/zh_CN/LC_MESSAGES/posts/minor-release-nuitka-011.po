"I just have just updated Nuitka to version 0.1.1 which is a bug fix "
"release to 0.1, which corrects many of the small things:"

"Updated the CPython test suite to 2.6.6rc and minimized much of existing "
"differences in the course."

"Compiles standalone executable that includes modules (with --deep "
"option), but packages are not yet included successfully."

"``sys.exc_info()`` works now mostly as expected (it's not a stack of "
"exceptions)."

"The biggest thing probably is the progress with exception tracebacks "
"objects in exception handlers, which were not there before (always "
"``None``). Having these in place will make it much more compatible. Also "
"with manually raised exceptions and assertions, tracebacks will now be "
"more correct to the line."

"On a bad news, I discovered that the ``compiler`` module that I use to "
"create the AST from Python source code, is not only deprecated, but also "
"broken. I created the `CPython bug <http://bugs.python.org/issue9656>`__ "
"about it, basically it cannot distinguish some code of the form ``d[1,] ="
" None`` from ``d[1] = None``. This will require a migration of the "
"``ast`` module, which should not be too challenging, but will take some "
"time."

"I am aiming at it for a 0.2 release. Generating wrong code (Nuitka sees "
"``d[1] = None`` in both cases) is a show blocker and needs a solution."

"So, yeah. It's better, it's there, but still experimental. You will find "
"its latest version here. Please try it out and let me know what you think"
