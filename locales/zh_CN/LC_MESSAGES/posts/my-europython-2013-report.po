"Back from Europython 2013 in Florence for a while now. I had a "
"presentation about my `Python compiler Nuitka </pages/overview.html>`_. "
"You can watch the Video on Youtube. I believe it's absolutely worth your "
"time. I was not doing a lot of \"why\" at all now, only \"what\", and "
"demo times, and answering questions:"

"The talk went really well. I believe one can clearly see that I felt "
"really good and at ease. The state presented is very good and progress - "
"there was a lot, so that was great. The `slides </pr/Nuitka-Presentation-"
"PyCON-EU-2013.pdf>`__ of the talk may also be interesting."

"Last years talk is also there. You can (maybe) see that I was 20kg more "
"weight then, and also *much* more excited, at least initially. "
"Background: I was surprised then that Guido van Rossum was attending the "
"talk, plus I was kind of not in the state of this year, the confidence "
"that people should believe, that things will work after that, was not yet"
" there. I knew it, but standing in front of a croud and saying, look I am"
" attempting what you consider impossible, or even have failed at, is not "
"easy:"

"So yeah, the progress happened since 2012 made a difference. Nuitka has "

"Consider that is the a *spare time effort*. Lots of people lauded it for "
"the out of the box experience, and how it just works. That's right. I put"
" a lot of focus on stability, correctness, and ease of use. In fact, "
"since my return, I have mostly worked on the feedback I got in that "
"domain."

"The feedback during the conference was great. While Nuitka is not yet "

"Since my return, I have been receiving a bunch of bug reports. Some of "

"One thing that came to my mind during the conference, witnessing the "
"large amount of non-satisfaction, was that the community is fed up with "
"the leadership. Questioned about lack of Python3 adoption, a PSF guy in "
"his presentation said they were 3 years into a 5 years plan, and got "

"It may be about time, somebody actually gets up, removes the GIL and has "
"a Python2.8 that is compatible. Obviously that's much more useful. It "
"could be a Python3.x with compatibility names of modules, ``print`` "
"statement, and ``dict.iteritems`` added, probably also making some of the"
" ``unicode`` mess more harmless, and providing ``unicode`` and ``long`` "
"built-in names."

"Considering that I have in fact been playing with the idea of forking "
"CPython top versions, to add things, that would allow Nuitka to work "
"better with it, that could be a staging ground, where such changes are "
"nurtured. On the other hand, Nuitka is too irrelevant yet to drive this, "
"and it would detract me away from it."
