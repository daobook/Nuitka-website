"Specifically I do know that the Debian package won't work on Debian "
"Squeeze, but only on Debian Wheezy (Testing) maybe it does on Ubuntu as "
"well, please report. If you have anything to criticize about the package,"
" let me know. There is no apt source now, I hope to get it into Debian "
"proper directly."

"UPDATE: After Stani's report that Ubuntu has an older Scons, I lowered "
"the dependency and updated the package on the page. It may now work on "
"Ubuntu as well."

"And then, the Windows installer still requires you to install MinGW and "
"add it to your path, but it's clearly a huge step ahead. It's created "
"with distutils, and that works very well. If you have the skills to "
"enhance it, so e.g. the PATH variable is changed, or it will launch a "
"MinGW install if not present, contact me and help."

"UPDATE: And the idea that I got while writing a reply to \"swong\" is "
"also now implemented. The new Nuitka on Windows simply guesses the PATH "
"to MinGW to be the default path ``C:\\MinGW`` or at least ``\\MinGW`` and"
" from there, it ought to just run after you installed it. Of course you "
"can still set your own PATH environment and make the pick yourself."
