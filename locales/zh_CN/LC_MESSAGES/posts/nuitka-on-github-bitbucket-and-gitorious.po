"This is to let you know, that I have *finally* carved in and created "
"accounts on all those \"social\" platforms, that deal with code. So far I"
" had resisted their terms (you pay us when we get sued), but I have given"
" up on that stance, it's likely irrelevant, as Nuitka won't get sued, and"
" if it is, those are not the issues."
