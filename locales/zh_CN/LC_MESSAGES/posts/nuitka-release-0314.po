"It is again the result of working towards compilation of a real program "
"(Mercurial). This time, I have added support for proper handling of "
"compiled types by the ``inspect`` module."

"Fix for \"Missing checks in parameter parsing with star list, star dict "
"and positional arguments\". There was whole in the checks for argument "
"counts, now the correct error is given. Fixed in 0.3.13a already."

"The simple slice operations with 2 values, not extended with 3 values, "
"were not applying the correct order for evaluation. Fixed in 0.3.13a "
"already."

"The simple slice operations couldn't handle ``None`` as the value for "

"The in-place simple slice operations evaluated the slice index "

"Run time patching the ``inspect`` module so it accepts compiled "
"functions, compiled methods, and compiled generator objects. The "
"``test_inspect`` test of CPython is nearly working unchanged with this."

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0314.rst:50
msgid ""
"The generator functions didn't have ``CO_GENERATOR`` set in their code "
"object, setting it made compatible with CPython in this regard too. The "
"inspect module will therefore return correct value for "
"``inspect.isgeneratorfunction()`` too."

"The ``setup.py`` is now apparently functional. The source releases for "

"The new source organisation makes packaging Nuitka really easy now. From "

"The patching of ``inspect`` works wonders for compatibility for those "
"programs that insist on checking types, instead of doing duck typing. The"
" function call problem, was an issue found by the Mercurial test suite."

"For the \"hg.exe\" to pass all of its test suite, more work may be "
"needed, this is the overall goal I am currently striving for. Once real "
"world programs like Mercurial work, we can use these as more meaningful "
"benchmarks and resume work on optimization."
