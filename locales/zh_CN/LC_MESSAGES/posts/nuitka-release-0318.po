"This is to inform you about the new stable release of Nuitka. This time "
"there are a few bug fixes, and the important step that triggered the "
"release: Nuitka has entered Debian Unstable. So you if want, you will get"
" stable Nuitka releases from now on via ``apt-get install nuitka``."

"The release cycle was too short to have much focus. It merely includes "
"fixes, which were available as hot fixes, and some additional "
"optimization and node tree cleanups, as well as source cleanups. But not "
"much else."

"Conditional statements with both branches empty were not optimized away "
"in all cases, triggering an assertion of code generation. Released as "
"0.3.17a hot fix already."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0318.rst:31
msgid ""
"Nuitka was considering directories to contain packages that had no "
"\"__init__.py\" which could lead to errors when it couldn't find the "
"package later in the compilation process. Released as 0.3.17a hot fix "
"already."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0318.rst:36
msgid ""
"When providing ``locals()`` to ``exec`` statements, this was not making "
"the ``locals()`` writable. The logic to detect the case that default "
"value is used (``None``) and be pessimistic about it, didn't consider the"
" actual value ``locals()``. Released as 0.3.17b hot fix already."

"Compatibility Fix: When no defaults are given, CPython uses ``None`` for "

"For built-in name references, there is now dedicated code to look them "

"It's not needed, instead at tree building, assert statements are "

"This allowed to remove code and complexity from the subsequent steps of "

"Moved built-in exception names and built-in names to a new module "

"Added cumulative ``tags`` to node classes for use in checks. Use it "

"This allowed to remove tricks played with adding module variable lookups "

"But of course, the real excitement is the \"type inference\" work. It "

"us more efficient."

"So when I learn something. e.g. ``assert`` is not special, I apply it to "

"possible, and to immediately benefit from such improvements."
