"The extended coverage from running the CPython 2.7 and CPython 3.2 "
"(partially) test suites shows in a couple of bug fixes and general "
"improvements in compatibility."

"Then there is a promised new feature that allows to compile whole "

"Also there is more Python3 compatibility, the CPython 3.2 test suite now "
"succeeds up to \"test_builtin.py\", where it finds that ``str`` doesn't "
"support the new parameters it has gained, future releases will improve on"
" this."

"And then of course, more re-formulation work, in this case, class "
"definitions are now mere simple functions. This and later function "

"The compiled method type can now be used with ``copy`` module. That "

"The ``assert`` statement as of Python2.7 creates the ``AssertionError`` "
"object from a given value immediately, instead of delayed as it was with "

"Added support creating compiled packages. If you give Nuitka a directory "
"with an \"__init__.py\" file, it will compile that package into a \".so\""
" file. Adding the package contents with ``--recurse-dir`` allows to "
"compile complete packages now. Later there will be a cleaner interface "
"likely, where the later is automatic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0324.rst:76

"Added support for providing directories as main programs. It's OK if they"

"compatible error message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0324.rst:80
msgid ""
"Added support for optimizing the ``super`` built-in. It was already "
"working correctly, but not optimized on CPython2. But for CPython3, the "
"variant without any arguments required dedicated code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0324.rst:84
msgid ""
"Added support for optimizing the ``unicode`` built-in under Python2. It "

"of Python3 in future releases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-0324.rst:88
msgid ""
"For Python3, lots of compatibility work has been done. The Unicode issues"
" appear to be ironed out now. The ``del`` of closure variables is allowed"
" and supported now. Built-ins like ``ord`` and ``chr`` work more "
"correctly and attributes are now interned strings, so that monkey "
"patching classes works."

"Migrated \"bin/benchmark.sh\" to Python as \"misc/run-valgrind.py\" and "

"The solution will be involved and take a bit of time. It will be about "
