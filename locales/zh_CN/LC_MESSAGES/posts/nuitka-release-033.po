"This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka "
"<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler, "
"`\"download now\" </doc/download.html>`_."

msgid ""
"This release of Nuitka continues the focus on performance. It also cleans"
" up a few open topics. One is \"doctests\", these are now extracted from "
"the CPython 2.6 test suite more completely. The other is that the CPython"
" 2.7 test suite is now passed completely. There is some more work ahead "
"though, to extract all of the \"doctests\" and to do that for both "
"versions of the tests."

"This means an even higher level of compatibility has been achieved, then "
