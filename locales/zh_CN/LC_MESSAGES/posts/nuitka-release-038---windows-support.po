"This is to inform you about the new release of Nuitka with some real news"
" and a slight performance increase. The significant news is added "
"\"Windows Support\". You can now hope to run Nuitka on Windows too and "
"have it produce working executables against either the standard Python "
"distribution or a MinGW compiled Python."

"There are still some small things to iron out, and clearly documentation "
"needs to be created, and esp. the DLL hell problem of ``msvcr90.dll`` vs."
" ``msvcrt.dll``, is not yet fully resolved, but appears to be not as "
"harmful, at least not on native Windows."

"I am thanking Khalid Abu Bakr for making this possible. I was surprised "
"to see this happen. I clearly didn't make it easy. He found a good way "
"around ``ucontext``, identifier clashes, and a very tricky symbol "

"Linux. Thanks a whole lot."

"Lambda generators were not fully compatible, their simple form could "

"This avoids the taking of a reference just because the "

"In general this would be possible for every assignment target that cannot"

"Branches with only ``pass`` inside are removed, ``pass`` statements are "

"There is now a global variable class per module. It appears that it is "
"indeed faster to roll out a class per module accessing the ``module *`` "
"rather than having one class and use a ``module **``, which is quite "
"disappointing from the C++ compiler."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-038---windows-support.rst:82

"Also ``MAKE_LIST`` and ``MAKE_TUPLE`` have gained special cases for the 0"
" arguments case. Even when the size of the variadic template parameters "
"should be known to the compiler, it seems, it wasn't eliminating the "
"branch, so this was a speedup measured with valgrind."

"Empty tried branches are now replaced when possible with "
"``try``/``except`` statements, ``try``/``finally`` is simplified in this "
"case. This gives a cleaner tree structure and less verbose C++ code which"
" the compiler threw away, but was strange to have in the first place."

"It now uses a ``PyObjectTemporary`` if it's assigned to multiple values, "
