"This is to inform you about the new stable release of `Nuitka "
"<https://nuitka.net>`_. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler, "
"`\"download now\" </doc/download.html>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:13
msgid ""
"This release marks the point, where Nuitka for the first time supports "
"all major current Python versions and all major features. It adds Python "
"3.3 support and it adds support for threading. And then there is a "
"massive amount of fixes that improve compatibility even further."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:18
msgid ""
"Aside of that, there is major performance work. One side is the "
"optimization of call performance (to CPython non-compiled functions) and "
"to compiled functions, both. This gave a serious improvement to "
"performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:23
msgid ""
"Then of course, we are making other, long term performance progress, as "
"in \"--experimental\" mode, the SSA code starts to optimize unused code "
"away. That code is not yet ready for prime time yet, but the trace "
"structure will hold."

msgid "Python3.3 support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:34
msgid ""
"The test suite of CPython3.3 passes now too. The ``yield from`` is now "
"supported, but the improved argument parsing error messages are not "
"implemented yet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:38
msgid ""
"Tracing user provided constants, now Nuitka warns about too large "
"constants produced during optimization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:41
msgid ""
"Line numbers of expressions are now updates as evaluation progresses. "
"This almost corrects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:44
msgid ""
"Now only expression parts that cannot raise, do not update, which can "
"still cause difference, but much less often, and then definitely useless."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:48
msgid "Experimental support for threads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:50
msgid ""
"Threading appears to work just fine in the most cases. It's not as "
"optimal as I wanted it to be, but that's going to change with time."

msgid "Optimization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:57
msgid ""
"Previous corrections for ``==``, ``!=``, and ``<=``, caused a performance"
" regression for these operations in case of handling identical objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:61
msgid ""
"For built-in objects of sane types (not ``float``), these operations are "
"now accelerated again. The overreaching acceleration of ``>=`` was still "
"there (bug, see below) and has been adapted too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:65
msgid ""
"Calling non-compiled Python functions from compiled functions was slower "
"than in CPython. It is now just as fast."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:68
msgid ""
"Calling compiled functions without keyword arguments has been accelerated"
" with a dedicated entry point that may call the implementation directly "
"and avoid parameter parsing almost entirely."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:72
msgid ""
"Making calls to compiled and non-compiled Python functions no longer "
"requires to build a temporary tuple and therefore is much faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:75
msgid ""
"Parameter parsing code is now more compact, and re-uses error raises, or "
"creates them on the fly, instead of hard coding it. Saves binary size and"
" should be more cache friendly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bug Fixes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:83
msgid "Corrected false optimization of ``a >= a`` on C++ level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:85
msgid ""
"When it's not done during Nuitka compile time optimization, the rich "
"comparison helper still contained short cuts for ``>=``. This is now the "
"same for all the comparison operators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:89
msgid ""
"Calling a function with default values, not providing it, and not "
"providing a value for a value without default, was not properly detecting"
" the error, and instead causing a run time crash."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:101
msgid "This now properly raises the ``TypeError`` exception."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:103
msgid ""
"Constants created with ``+`` could become larger than the normally "
"enforced limits. Not as likely to become huge, but still potentially an "
"issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:107
msgid ""
"The ``vars`` built-in, when used on something without ``__dict__`` "
"attribute, was giving ``AttributeError`` instead of ``TypeError``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:110
msgid ""
"When re-cursing to modules at compile time, script directory and current "
"directory were used last, while at run time, it was the other way around,"
" which caused overloaded standard library modules to not be embedded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:115
msgid "Thanks for the patch to James Michael DuPont."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:117

"Super without arguments was not raising the correct ``RuntimeError`` "
"exception in functions that cannot be methods, but ``UnboundLocalError`` "
"instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:126
msgid ""
"Generators no longer use ``raise StopIteration`` for return statements, "
"because that one is not properly handled in ``try``/``except`` clauses, "
"where it's not supposed to trigger, while ``try``/``finally`` should be "
"honored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:131
msgid ""
"Exception error message when throwing non-exceptions into generators was "
"not compatible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:134
msgid ""
"The use of ``return`` with value in generators is a ``SyntaxError`` "
"before Python3.3, but that was not raised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:137
msgid ""
"Variable names of the \"__var\" style need to be mangled. This was only "
"done for classes, but not for functions contained in classes, there they "

"For containers (``tuple``, ``list``, ``set``, ``dict``) defined on the "

"For function calls, class creations, slice objects, this code is now re-"

"immediately, reducing noise in optimization steps."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:158
msgid ""
"The parameter parsing code got cleaned up. There were a lot of relics "
"from previously explored paths. And error raises were part of the "

"This helped to find a case of duplicate use in the complex call helpers "
"functions. Code generation will now notice this kind of duplication in "
"debug mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:171
msgid ""
"The complex call helper functions were manually taking variable closure, "
"which made these functions inconsistent to other functions, e.g. no "
"variable version was allocated to assignments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-044.rst:175
msgid ""
"Removing the manual setting of variables allowed a huge reduction of code"

"The ``site`` module is now imported explicitly in the ``__main__`` "

"The ``doctest`` to code generation didn't successfully handle all tests, "
