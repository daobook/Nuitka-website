"Compatibility: Added support for the (unofficial) C-Python API "
"``Py_GetArgcArgv`` that was causing ``prctl`` module to fail loading on "
"ARM platforms."

"Compatibility: The proper error message template for complex call "
"arguments is now detected as compile time. There are changes coming, that"
" are already in some pre-releases of CPython."

"Windows: Detect the MinGW compiler arch and compare it to the Python "
"arch. In case of a mismatch, the compiler is not used. Otherwise "
"compilation or linking gives hard to understand errors. This also rules "
"out MinGW32 as a compiler that can be used, as its arch doesn't match "
"MinGW64 32 bits variant."

"This release advances the scalability of Nuitka somewhat. The two pass "
