"This release is aiming at preparatory changes to enable optimization "
"based on SSA analysis, introducing a variable registry, so that variables"
" no longer trace their references to themselves."

"Using new variable registry, now properly detecting actual need for "
"sharing variables. Optimization may discover that it is unnecessary to "
"share a variable, and then it no longer is. This also allows ``--debug`` "
"without it reporting unused variable warnings on Python3."

"Updated internal version of Scons to 2.3.2, which breaks support for VS "
