"This releases contains important bug fixes for regressions of the 0.6.8 "
"series which had relatively many problems. Not all of these could be "
"addressed as hotfixes, and other issues were even very involved, causing "
"many changes to be necessary."

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:18
msgid ""
"There are also many general improvements and performance work for tracing"
" and loops, but the full potential of this will not be unlocked with this"

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:26
msgid ""
"Fix, loop optimization sometimes didn't determinate, effectively making "
"Nuitka run forever, with no indication why. This has been fixed and a "
"mechanism to give up after too many attempts has been added."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:31
msgid ""
"Fix, closure taking object allowed a brief period where the garbage "

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:44
msgid ""
"Windows: Avoid encoding issues for Python3 on more systems, by going from"

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:48

"Windows: Do not crash when warning about uninstalled MSVC using Python3. "

"Standalone: The ``certifi`` data file is now supported for all modules "

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:71
msgid ""
"Standalone: The bytecode for the standard library had filenames pointing "
"to the original installation attached. While these were not used, but "
"replaced at runtime, they increased the size of the binary, and leaked "
"information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:76
msgid ""
"Standalone: The path of ``sys.executable`` was not None, but pointing to "

"Windows: Added support for using Python 2.7 through a symlink too. This "

"Caching of compiled C files is now checked with ccache and clcache, and "

" This can accelerate the re-compile very much, even if you have to go "
"through Nuitka compilation itself, which is not (yet) cached."

"Memory used for value tracing has been lowered by removing unnecessary "

"Windows: Prevent scons from scanning for MSVC when asked to use MinGW64. "

"Windows: Use function level linking with MSVC, this will allow for "

"More correct Debian copyright file, made formatting of emails in source "
"code consistent."

msgid "Summary"
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:169
msgid ""
"The main focus of this release has been bug fixes with only a little "
"performance work due to the large amount of regressions and other "
"findings from the last release."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:173
msgid ""
"The new constants loading for removes a major scalability problem. The "
"checked and now consistently possible use of ``ccache`` and ``clcache`` "
"allows for much quicker recompilation. Nuitka itself can still be slow in"
" some cases, but should have seen some improvements too. Scalability will"
" have to remain a focus for the next releases too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:179
msgid ""
"The other focus, was to make the binaries contain no original path "
"location, which is interesting for standalone mode. Nuitka should be very"
" good in this area now."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:183
msgid ""
"For optimization, the new loop code is again better. But it was also very"
" time consuming, to redo it, yet again. This has prevented other "
"optimization to be added."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:187
msgid ""
"And then for correctness, the locals scope work, while very invasive, was"
" necessary, to handle the usage of locals inside of contractions, but "
"also will be instrumental for function inlining to become generally "
"available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../posts/nuitka-release-069.rst:192
msgid ""
"So, ultimately, this release is a necessary intermediate step. Upcoming "
"releases will be able to focus more clearly on run time performance again"
" as well as on scalability for generated C code."
