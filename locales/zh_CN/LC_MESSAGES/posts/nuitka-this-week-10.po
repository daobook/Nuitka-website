"So the query for type shape has been enhanced to return not only a type "
"shape saying that `int+float -> float`, but also now an object that "
"describes impact on control flow of the program. This can then say e.g. "
"that this doesn't execute arbitrary code, and that it does not modify "
"input values, things used in the code generation to avoid error checks, "
