"This was the most crazy ride and fun. Became the admin of an active sub-"

"So, the 0.6.3 release (btw. on Windows, be sure to use the 0.6.3.1 "

"However, this changed a lot. An idea that came to my mind for how to do "

"The reason, ``+`` and ``*`` were done first, is that they have special "

"I am saving a deeper explanation of 3 things we will need for the next "

"to apply the special code as much as possible, and that is not yet fully "

"Recently however, I felt there is more time, after GSoC student selection"

"That was a turn down, but turns out, nothing it finds is stuff that "

"The dependency walker now finishes a file in milliseconds. Actually the "
"``pefile`` is now slow (surely it ought to be compiled), and takes some "
