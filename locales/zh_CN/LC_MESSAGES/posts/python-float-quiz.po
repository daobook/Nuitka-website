"The correct answer is that there is one float that is not equal to itself"

"Surprised? I was too! I only learned it while doing my `Python compiler "
"Nuitka </pages/overview.html>`_ and I made it a separate posting, because"
" it really surprised me how this could possibly happen. A builtin type "
"that breaks fundamental assumptions like \"x == x\"."
