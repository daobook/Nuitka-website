"python-3/>`__ there is just about everything right. I still want to add "

"Python3 is a fork of the Python community, that has left the user base "
"largely behind. After developing features very conservatively for a long "
"time (``from __future__ import division`` and stuff), where features were"
" first available but not active by default, that whole \"Python 3000\" "
"thing came up."

"Misguided, after having maintained CPython on a level of excellence for "
"such a long time, there was a sense of \"finally we get to make free "
"choices\". I can understand that. And having witnessed Gnome 2.0.0, and "
"KDE 4.0.0, I even start to believe that there is some kind of underlying "
"law. Something that makes people want to start over."

"That \"5 years plan\" Alex mentioned has failed, and everybody knows that"
" without solving the GIL within the next 5 years, i.e. another "
"incompatible Python change, it will likely become obsolete."

"In terms of Python2.8, call it that way. Or have a 3.5 that has ``print``"
" statement, and then all kinds of incompatible changes to Python3 to make"
" it behave sane ``bytes(7)`` needs to do what ``str(7)`` once it. That "
"would be about ``from __past__ import ....`` I suppose."

"I also had another idea, having a \"python2\" built-in module that "
"carries a CPython2 interpreter and proxy objects for instances, where "
"they talk to another with incompatible types (new ``bytes``/``unicode`` "
"to old ``str``)."

"Due to my work on that `Python compiler </pages/overview.html>`__ that "
"should have existed 20 years ago, I am familiar enough, to actually be "

"CPython is developed by volunteers, and as such, they are neither obliged"
" to do what we need, nor will they bend to any amount of posting. We need"
" to get our acts together or it's not happening, and we are people who "
"care about Python relevancy."

"There may not be nearly enough overlap of people capable and caring. And "
"that would be a tremendous amount of work. Highly speculative, in the "

"And then, when you got that sorted out, expect a hostile reaction from "
"the core developers and/or PSF. Whatever it is, that you develop, you "
"won't be able to call it Python 2.8, as they are going to hate it."

"And finally, as a course of action, that may even bring the complete "
"downfall of Python as a community. The controversy associated is not for "
"everybody, and we don't need a libreoffice/openoffice situation in "
"Python, do we."

"It's a pity, because clearly, for Nuitka there would be a bunch of "
