"I would normally generate code examples now with \"rst2html\" and replace"

"The documentation of Nuitka is in ReST and I even intend to expand it "

"Other stuff in favor of it, is that Wordpress or any CMS needs more "

"Is Mynth an appropriate intermediate step? Do I really want to learn one "
"of these strange templating languages or even consider software that has "
"no Debian package. I never considered \"virtualenv\" and \"pip\" much of "
"options to run software on a website. I guess I am more tied to Debian "
"than to Python still."

"Over the last months I have occasionally looked at Pyramids, but it seems"
" overly complex, if all you want is to simplify the authoring. I have "

"I may end up with using ReST to generate HTML which is then uploaded via "

"the post update problem. But at least will let me edit more easily."
