"This post is about a feature often requested, but so far not available "
"feature of Nuitka. Please see the page `\"What is Nuitka?\" "
"</pages/overview.html>`_ for clarification of what it is now and what it "
"wants to be."

"In forums, and in Google, people are looking at a Python compiler, also "
"as a way of deployment. It should offer what `py2exe "
"<http://www.py2exe.org/>`_ does, allow installation independent of "
"Python."

"Well, for a long time it didn't. But thanks to recent contributions, it's"
" upcoming for the next release, Nuitka 0.4.3, and it's in the current "
"pre-releases."

"It works by adding ``--portable`` to the command line. So this should "
"work for you:"

"Right now, it will create a folder \"_python\" with DLLs, and "
"\"_python.zip\" with standard library modules used along to the \"your-"
"program.exe\". Copy these to another machine, without a Python "
"installation, and it will (should) work. Making that statement fully true"
" may need refinements, as some DLL dependencies might not be defined yet."

"We may improve it in the future to meld everything into one executable "
"for even easier deployment."

"You are more than welcome to experiment with it. To do so, download "
"Nuitka from the `download page </pages/download.html>`_ and give it a "

"Of course, Nuitka is not about replacing \"py2exe\" primarily, it's only "
"a side effect of what we do. Our major goal is of course to accelerate "
"Python, but surely nobody minds achieving the two things at the same "
"time."

"And while the post is labeled \"Windows\", this feature also works for "
"Linux at least too. It's just that the lack of Python installations on "
"client systems is far more widespread on this platform."

"To me, as this is from a contributor, it's another sign of Nuitka gaining"
" adoption for real usage. My personal \"py2exe\" experience is "
"practically not existing, I have never used it. And I will only merge the"
" improvements into the Nuitka project as provided by others. My focus for"
" the time to come is of course the compile time and run time "
"optimization."
