"Urllib3 standalone test have already been covered. Manual testing is now "
"done to compare the pytest results of a nuitka wheel built using ``python"
" setup.py bdist_nuitka`` to the regular pytest of the urllib3 package. "
"Testing is done to ensure that nuitka is building the wheel correctly. If"
" the pytests pass/fail in the same way, that means Nuitka built the wheel"
" properly. Else if the tests differ, then something is wrong. Virtualenv "
"is used to create a clean environment with no outside pollution."

"At first, the urllib3 nuitka-wheel pytest was crashing because of the "
"unsafe assumption that imports will always exist (which is not the case "

"<https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/413>`__ was filed to record and "
"fix this bug."
