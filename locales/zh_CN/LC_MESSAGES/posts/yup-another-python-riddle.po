"See, the dictionary is stable, once it gets reordered, due to hash "
"values, but then it stays fixed. Which is pretty OK, and using a fixed "
"hash value, it's deterministic. Random hashing is not good for comparison"

"Look at how the result of \"dict\" is not reproducing itself, when used "

"I am suspecting a difference between presized and non-presized "
