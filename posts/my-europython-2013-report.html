<h1>My Europython 2013 report<a class="headerlink" href="#my-europython-2013-report" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>Back from Europython 2013 in Florence for a while now. I had a
presentation about my <a class="reference external" href="/pages/overview.html">Python compiler Nuitka</a>.
You can watch the Video on Youtube. I believe it’s absolutely worth your
time. I was not doing a lot of “why” at all now, only “what”, and demo
times, and answering questions:</p>
<div class="video_wrapper" style="">
<iframe allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDjXZY_8d58" style="border: 0; height: 345px; width: 560px">
</iframe></div><p>The talk went really well. I believe one can clearly see that I felt
really good and at ease. The state presented is very good and progress -
there was a lot, so that was great. The <a class="reference external" href="/pr/Nuitka-Presentation-PyCON-EU-2013.pdf">slides</a> of the talk may also be
interesting.</p>
<p>And it definitely raised a lot of interest.</p>
<p>Last years talk is also there. You can (maybe) see that I was 20kg more
weight then, and also <em>much</em> more excited, at least initially.
Background: I was surprised then that Guido van Rossum was attending the
talk, plus I was kind of not in the state of this year, the confidence
that people should believe, that things will work after that, was not
yet there. I knew it, but standing in front of a croud and saying, look
I am attempting what you consider impossible, or even have failed at, is
not easy:</p>
<div class="video_wrapper" style="">
<iframe allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDHkla5rllg" style="border: 0; height: 345px; width: 560px">
</iframe></div><p>There are also the <a class="reference external" href="/pr/Nuitka-Presentation-PyCON-EU-2012.pdf">slides</a> of that talk which may
also be interesting, but of course are outdated somewhat now.</p>
<section id="years-make-differences">
<h2>Years make differences<a class="headerlink" href="#years-make-differences" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>So yeah, the progress happened since 2012 made a difference. Nuitka has
proven things. Let’s see what this year does to it. I would hope for
real type inference optimization and portable mode to be there next
year.</p>
<p>Consider that is the a <em>spare time effort</em>. Lots of people lauded it for
the out of the box experience, and how it just works. That’s right. I
put a lot of focus on stability, correctness, and ease of use. In fact,
since my return, I have mostly worked on the feedback I got in that
domain.</p>
<p>But for the relatively small amount of time I can invest (outside of
holidays), it’s make very fast progress.</p>
</section>
<section id="out-of-the-box-thinking">
<h2>Out of the box thinking<a class="headerlink" href="#out-of-the-box-thinking" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The feedback during the conference was great. While Nuitka is not yet
seeing a lot of users, and not as many contributions or donations as I
would hope for, but that’s kind of expected with my out of the box
thinking there.</p>
<p>Few people at Europython really need a Python compiler. The most
important exception are scientific people, doing number crunching. And I
made some interesting contacts there.</p>
<p>Since my return, I have been receiving a bunch of bug reports. Some of
which were unfortunately regressions of 0.4.4, and these got fixed in
two hotfix releases. Currently 0.4.4.2 is released, and contains a huge
amount of fixes, mostly stuff found by the surge new users.</p>
<p>But I deserved that, having said that I didn’t have to do hotfixes for a
while now.</p>
</section>
<section id="florence">
<h2>Florence<a class="headerlink" href="#florence" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Such a lovely place, and so lovely people. It’s a tourist place, true,
but it’s very open minded. The food is extremely good. And going from
the conference hotel straight over to the river to meet up and have a
few beers was very comfortable for after-conference stuff.</p>
<p>Now that I have been there 2 times, and the conference even 3 times,
it’s moving on, to Berlin, which I sort of regret. Knowing the place
somewhat definitely is an advantage by itself.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-revolution">
<h2>Python Revolution<a class="headerlink" href="#python-revolution" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>One thing that came to my mind during the conference, witnessing the
large amount of non-satisfaction, was that the community is fed up with
the leadership. Questioned about lack of Python3 adoption, a PSF guy in
his presentation said they were 3 years into a 5 years plan, and got
interrupted by laughter.</p>
<p>It may be about time, somebody actually gets up, removes the GIL and has
a Python2.8 that is compatible. Obviously that’s much more useful. It
could be a Python3.x with compatibility names of modules, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code>
statement, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict.iteritems</span></code> added, probably also making some of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> mess more harmless, and providing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unicode</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">long</span></code> built-in names.</p>
<p>Considering that I have in fact been playing with the idea of forking
CPython top versions, to add things, that would allow Nuitka to work
better with it, that could be a staging ground, where such changes are
nurtured. On the other hand, Nuitka is too irrelevant yet to drive this,
and it would detract me away from it.</p>
</section>
<section id="gains">
<h2>Gains<a class="headerlink" href="#gains" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>So Nuitka got a lot more exposure. And one guy watching the talk even
created a really <a class="reference external" href="/_static/Nuitka-Logo-Symbol.png">nice logo</a> for
it. I will make it a separate announcement though, and the next release
is going to use it.</p>
<p>And in the aftermath, there were much bug useful reports. And new ideas.
And reinforcement that what I am doing is actually useful to some people
already.</p>
</section>
<section id="donations">
<h2>Donations<a class="headerlink" href="#donations" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>My travel to Florence was in part funded by donations. Thanks a lot to
all of you who have given, and who would like to also <a class="reference external" href="/pages/donations.html">make a donation</a>. Should I receive sufficient donations, I
intend to go to FOSDEM 2014 as well.</p>
<p>Going to Berlin will be a bit cheaper this time around, as I can travel
there via train.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The Europython 2012 and 2013 both are among the times of my life.</p>
