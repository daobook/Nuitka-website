<p>For quite a bit, there have been no status posts, not for lack of news,
but a lot has happened indeed. I just seem to post a <em>lot</em> more to the
mailing list than I do here. Especially about unfinished stuff, which is
essentially for a project like Nuitka everything that’s going on.</p>
<p>Like I previously said, I am shy to make public postings about
unfinished stuff and that’s going to continue. But I am breaking it, to
keep you up to date with where Nuitka has been going lately.</p>
<p>And with release focuses, I have been making some actual changes that I
think are worth talking about.</p>

<div class="section" id="ssa-single-state-assignment-form">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">SSA (Single State Assignment Form)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#ssa-single-state-assignment-form" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The SSA using release has been made last summer. Recent releases have
lifted more and more restrictions on where and now it is applied and
made sure the internal status is consistent and true. And that trend is
going to continue even more.</p>
<p>For shared variables (closure variables and module variables), Nuitka is
still too conservative to make optimization. Code does annotate value
escapes, but it’s not yet trusting it. The next releases will focus on
lifting that kind of restriction, and for quality of result, that will
mean making a huge jump ahead once that works, so module variables used
locally a lot will become even faster to use then and subject to static
optimization too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="function-inlining">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Function Inlining</a><a class="headerlink" href="#function-inlining" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>When doing my talk to EuroPython 2015, I was demoing it that, and
indeed, what a break through. The circumstances under which it is done
are still far too limited though. Essentially that ability is there, but
will not normally be noticeable yet due to other optimization, e.g.
functions are most often module variables and not local to the using
function.</p>
<p>More code generation improvements will be needed to be able to inline
functions that might raise an exception. Also the “cost” of inlining a
function is also very much an unsolved issue. It will become the focus
again, once the SSA use as indicated above expands to module variables,
as then inlining other things than local functions will be possible too.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of things to do for this to really make a difference
to your programs. But it’s still great to have that part solved so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scalability">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Scalability</a><a class="headerlink" href="#scalability" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<div class="section" id="parameter-parsing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Parameter Parsing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#parameter-parsing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Recent releases have replaced some of the oldest code of Nuitka, the one
that generated special argument parsing for each function individually,
now replaced with generic code, that surprisingly is often even faster,
although quick entry points were tough to beat.</p>
<p>That gives the C backend compiler a much easier time. Previously 3 C
functions were created per Python level function, two of which could get
really big with many arguments, and these are no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="variable-error-messages">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Variable Error Messages</a><a class="headerlink" href="#variable-error-messages" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Something similar was going on with variable error messages. Each had
their exception value pre-computed and created at module load time. Most
of these are of course unused. This has been replaced with code that
generates it on the fly, resulting in a lot less constants code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-objects">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Code Objects</a><a class="headerlink" href="#code-objects" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>And another thing was to look after code objects, of which there often
were two for each Python level function. The one used or the frame
during run time and the one used in the function object, differered
often, sometimes by small things like flags or local variable names.</p>
<p>That of course was just the result of not passing that along, but
created cached objects with hopefully the same options, but that not
being true.</p>
<p>Resolving that, and sharing the code object used for creation and then
the frame is gives less complex C code too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimization">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Optimization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#optimization" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The scalability of Nuitka also depends much on generated code size. With
the optimization become more clever, less code is generated, and that
trend will continue as more structural optimization are applied.</p>
<p>Every time e.g. an exception is identified to not happen, this removes
the corresponding error exits from the C code, which then makes it
easier for the C compiler. Also more specialized code as we now have or
dictionaries, is often less complex to it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compatibility">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Compatibility</a><a class="headerlink" href="#compatibility" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Important things have happened here. Full compatibility mode is planned
to not be the default anymore in upcoming releases, but that will only
mean to not be stupid compatible, but to e.g. have more complete error
messages than CPython, more correct line numbers, or for version
differences, the best Python version behaviour.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The stable release has full support for Python 3.5, including the new
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">async</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">await</span></code> functions. So recent releases can pronounce it
as fully supported which was quite a feat.</p>
<p>I am not sure, if you can fully appreciate the catch up game needed to
play here. CPython clearly implements a lot of features, that I have to
emulate too. That’s going to repeat for every major release.</p>
<p>The good news is that the function type of Nuitka is now specialized to
the generators and classes, and that was a massive cleanup of its core
that was due anyway. The generators have no more their own function
creation stuff and that has been helpful with a lot of other stuff.</p>
<p>Another focus driven from Python3, is to get ahead with type shape
tracing and type inference of dictionary, and value tracing. To fully
support Python3 classes, we need to work on something that is a
dictionary a-like, and that will only ever be efficient if we have that.
Good news is that the next release is making progress there too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Performance</a><a class="headerlink" href="#performance" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<div class="section" id="graphs-and-benchmarks">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Graphs and Benchmarks</a><a class="headerlink" href="#graphs-and-benchmarks" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>I also presented this weak point to EuroPython 2015 and my plan on how
to resolve it. Unfortunately, nothing really happened here. My plan is
still to use what the PyPy people have developed as vmprof.</p>
<p>So that is not progressing, and I could need help with that definitely.
Get in contact if you think you can.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standalone">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Standalone</a><a class="headerlink" href="#standalone" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The standalone mode of Nuitka was pretty good, and continued to improve
further, but I don’t care much.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-stuff">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Other Stuff</a><a class="headerlink" href="#other-stuff" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<div class="section" id="europython-2015">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">EuroPython 2015</a><a class="headerlink" href="#europython-2015" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>This was a blast. Meeting people who knew Nuitka but not me was a
regular occurrence. And many people well appreciate my work. It felt
much different than the years before.</p>
<p>I was able to present Nuitka’s function in-lining indeed there, and this
high goal that I set myself, quite impressed people.</p>
<p>Also I made many new contacts, largely with the scientific community. I
hope to find work with data scientists in the coming years. More amd
more it looks like my day job should be closer to Nuitka and my
expertise in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="funding">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Funding</a><a class="headerlink" href="#funding" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Nuitka receives the occasional <a class="reference external" href="/pages/donations.html">donation</a> and those make me very happy.
As there is no support from organization like the PSF, I am all on my
own there.</p>
<p>This year I want to travel to Europython 2016. It would be sweet if
aside of my free time it wouldn’t also cost me money. So please consider
donating some more, as these kind of events are really helpul to Nuitka.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collaborators">

<p>You can join and should do so now, just <a class="reference external" href="/doc/user-manual.html#join-nuitka">follow this link</a> or become part of
the mailing list (since closed) and help me there with request I make,
e.g. review posts of mine, test out things, pick up small jobs, answer
questions of newcomers, you know the drill probably.</p>

<p>There is a Youtube channel of mine with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKO58t9ADuF6o_Dcmve1DXpUkUEEVvDux">all the videos of Nuitka so far</a>
and I have been preparing myself with proper equipment to make Videos of
Nuitka, but so far nothing has come out of that.</p>
<p>I do however really want to change that. Let’s see if it happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="twitter">

</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Future</a><a class="headerlink" href="#future" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>So, there is multiple things going on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type Inference</p>
<p>With SSA in place, Nuitka starts to recognize types, and treat things
that work something assigned from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{}</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code> built-in with
special nodes and code.</p>
<p>That’s going to be a lot of work. For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> there
are very important use cases, where the code can be much better. But
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code> is the hardest case, and to get the structure of shape
tracing right, we are going there first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shape Analyisis</p>
<p>The plan for types, is not to use them, but the more general shapes,
things that will be more prevalent than actual type information in a
program. In fact the precise knowledge will be rare, but more often,
we will just have a set of operations performed on a variable, and be
able to guess from there.</p>
<p>Shape analysis will begin though with concrete types like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code>.
The reason is that some re-formulations like Python3 classes should
not use locals, but dictionary accesses throughout for full
compatibility. Tracing that correctly to be effectively the same code
quality will allow to make that change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plug-ins</p>
<p>Something I wish I could have shown at EuroPython was plug-ins to
Nuitka. It has become more complete, and some demo plug-ins for say
Qt plugins or multiprocessing, are starting to work, but it’s not
progressing recently. The API will need work and of course
documentation. Hope is for this to expand Nuitka’s reach and appeal
to get more contributors.</p>
<p>It would be sweet, if there were any takers, aiming to complete these
things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nested frames</p>
<p>One result of in-lining will be nested frames still present for
exceptions to be properly annotated, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">locals</span></code> giving different
sets of locals and so on.</p>
<p>Some cleanup of these will be needed for code generation and SSA to
be able to attach variables to some sort of container, and for a
function to be able to reference different sets of these.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know, if you are willing to help. I really need that help to make
things happen faster. Nuitka will become more and more important only.
And with your help, things will be there sooner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-focus">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Release Focus</a><a class="headerlink" href="#release-focus" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>One thing I have started recently, is to make changes to Nuitka focused
to just one goal, and to only deal with the rare bug in other fields,
but not much else at all. So instead of across the board improvements in
just about everything, I have e.g. in the last release added type
inference for dictionaries and special nodes and their code generation
for dictionary operations.</p>
<p>This progresses Nuitka in one field. And the next release then e.g. will
only focus on making the performance comparison tool, and not continue
much in other fields.</p>
<p>That way, more “flow” is possible and more visible progress too. As an
example of this, these are the focuses of last releases.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Full Python 3.5 on a clean base with generators redone so that
coroutines fit in nicely.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalability of C compilation with argument parsing redone</p></li>
<li><p>Next release soon: Shape analysis of subscript usages and
optimization to exact dictionaries</p></li>
<li><p>Next release thereafter: Comparison benchmarking (vmprof, resolving C
level function identifiers easier)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other focuses will also happen, but that’s too far ahead. Mostly like
some usability improvements will be the focus of a release some day.
Focus is for things that are too complex to attack as a side project,
and therefore never happen although surely possible.</p>
<p>Digging into Python3.5 coroutines and their semantics was hard enough,
and the structural changes needed to integrate them properly with not
too much special casing, but rather removing existing special cases
(generator functions) was just too much work to ever happen while also
doing other stuff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">

<p>So I am very excited about Nuitka. It feels like the puzzle is coming
together finally, with type inference becoming a real thing. And should
dictionaries be sorted out, the real important types, say <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float</span></code> for
scientific use cases, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list</span></code> for others, will be easy to
make.</p>
<p>With this, and then harder import association (knowing what other
modules are), and module level SSA tracing that can be trusted, we can
finally expect Nuitka to be generally fast and deserve to be called a
compiler.</p>
<p>That will take a while, but it’s likely to happen in 2016. Let’s see if
I will get the funding to go to EuroPython 2016, that would be great.</p>
